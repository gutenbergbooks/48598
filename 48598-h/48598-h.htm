<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Africa is gradually becoming so civilised that there
are few places left where the adventurer (the man
who holds a human life as cheaply as the sportsman
holds that of a wild pheasant) may hope to flourish.
But for such an individual there remains on the
Eastern Abyssinian border a territory, difficult to
penetrate, inhabited by wild warlike tribes, through
whom can be carried out a policy of murder and
rapine against the peaceful native tribes under
British protection. And on the Abyssinian borders
you may find him, ever ready to organise a wild
raid South or East (or West for that matter) into
the administered territories of the British, whose
sentinel-outposts are ever watching and waiting to
turn him from his prey. Of the tribes inhabiting
this wild border-land I have selected from many but
one to speak of&mdash;the Somali of British Somaliland.</p>

<p>The Somali has deeply religious tendencies and
is the stoutest of Mussulmans. In addition to the
Mahomedan code, which he obeys implicitly, he has
a complicated tribal code of his own. He knows
much, and practises what he knows, of the old Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and Biblical hygienic laws. He recognises the right
of man to slay, providing he pays&mdash;one hundred
camels for a man, fifty for a woman. The Somali
respects a woman, and reverences chastity.</p>

<p>The Somali wanders afar. You will find him
working as deck hand, fireman, or steward, on all
the great liners trading to the East. I know of a
Somali tobacconist in Cardiff, a Somali mechanic in
New York, and a Somali trader in Bombay, the latter
of whom speaks French, English, and Italian
fluently. The Somali considers that British magistrates
are appointed to his country solely to relieve
the monotony of his life, and he pesters theirs with
all kinds of cases, both petty and intricate.</p>

<p>The Somali in his own country is conservative.
He has little time for men not of his own race,
excepting perhaps the Arab Mullahs, a few of whom
wander amongst his people teaching the great
"Mahomedan truths." He is never internally at
rest. His tribe is divided into sections, sub-sections
and clans, and the clans are for ever disagreeing
amongst themselves. The sub-sections then interfere,
and it may so happen that quarrels extend to
the sections. If these are not settled the result
may be much bloodshed. But it is always here that
the British administration steps in, and to it
nowadays the Somali turns to settle his domestic
affairs when they get beyond his control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1920 I was privileged to take part in the
successful operations carried out against that great
adventurer, Hassan Abdullah, the Mad Mullah, and
with him these pages end. They portray only the
human side of life on a wild African outpost, and
describe the men and incidents recorded exactly as
I have seen them, and as they have occurred. For
fuller information I refer the reader to the official
reports and the works of more conventional writers.</p>

<h3>ZEILA</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Early history&mdash;Slave trade&mdash;Gen. Gordon&mdash;Somali tribes.</p></blockquote>


<p>Zeila is a port on the British Somaliland coast. It
lies some twenty-eight miles South of the French
port of Djibouti, and is one hundred and seventy
miles North-East of the Abyssinian town of Harrar.
Little is known of its history, but here is the story
of the "oldest inhabitant" for what it is worth. In
essential details it is fairly accurate.</p>

<p>Sheikh Sa'du-d-din was the first Arab of importance
to visit the place. He occupied the island
named after him, situated a few miles North of the
present town. There he built stone houses, and a
large tank to preserve and store the rain water. The
island is a dreary, waterless waste of sand, so what
more natural than that the good man, who was a
strict Mahomedan and a great warrior, should vary
the monotony of existence by crossing to the mainland
to raid and convert the heathen Galla, who
grazed their herds in the vicinity of the present town.</p>

<p>The Sheikh married a woman from the Dowa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
people who lived between the Danakils and the
Abyssinians. When he was killed his progeny
found their way back to their mother's town, where
their descendants are still to be found. This town
of Dowa or Daoua has, according to my informant,
a custom or law that forbids any unmarried
Mahomedan man to sleep within its precincts for
even one night. Immediately on arrival the stranger
is provided with a wife, who remains with him as
long as he lives in the town. Should he leave it he
may take neither wife nor children away.</p>

<p>For many years after the Sheikh's death no one
knows what happened, but it would appear that
Arab traders began regularly to visit the Somali
coast, where they carried on a lucrative trade by
exchanging grain and cloth for coffee, ivory, and
other products, brought in from the high country
round Harrar. At first these Arabs did not make
their homes on the coast, but returned at the end of
every season to Arabia. Probably the first residents
at Zeila were renegade Arabs, guilty of some
unpurged offence in their own country, to which they
were afraid to return. When the other traders went
away these men built huts and settled down. As
nothing happened to them, and they probably did
very well, their more honest brethren followed their
example in taking up their permanent residence on
the coast. In this way began the town of Zeila.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Arab Governor, "headman" would be
a more correct title, known to my informant was
called Syyed. He cannot remember his full name.
Syyed it was who built a wall around the town for
purposes of defence, and his great-grandson, a
carpenter by profession, lives in Zeila to-day. One
fine day there came to Syyed the Governor, a Somal,
by name Sharmarki Ali, to report his arrival and
intention of relieving the former of his arduous
duties. They were very casual in those days, and
as this was the first Syyed had heard of Sharmarki
Ali he exerted himself with such success to procure
Sharmarki's departure that the latter found it most
expedient to revisit Hodeida, from which port he had
come, on urgent private affairs.</p>

<p>These attended to&mdash;they included the fitting out
of a force of fifty Somals, armed with muzzle loading
guns and two cannon&mdash;Sharmarki chartered two
dhows and returned with his army to Zeila. This
time nothing would induce him to go away. There
was a violent argument which Sharmarki settled by
loading up his two cannon to the muzzle with powder
and sand and firing them close to the walls of the
town. Syyed and his followers, who had never
heard anything like the tremendous explosions made
by these guns in their lives before, became afraid
and ran away.</p>

<p>Sharmarki entered the town in triumph, assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the governorship, made overtures to the friendly
disposed tribes in the surrounding district, and was
comfortably lining his pockets when history made
arrangements to repeat itself. The Governor of
Hodeida, ever short of cash, was bribed by one
Abubakr Ibrahim Shebani, nowadays better known
as Abubakr Basha, a Danakil, to fit him out with a
small force of good soldiers which would be unlikely
to run away from a big noise, for the purpose of
taking Zeila. Without doubt the Governor of
Hodeida considered he was leasing Zeila by contract,
as he was quite entitled to do. Abubakr
Basha convinced Sharmarki Ali that for his health's
sake he required a change of air, and was left in
charge of the town. This he proceeded to exploit
in much the same way that all his adventurer-predecessors
had done.</p>

<p>The next person of importance to put in an
appearance came with no less than five hundred
soldiers and ten cannon. He was an Egyptian
Basha, and proceeded to take charge of Zeila in the
name of his government. He called in all the
Somal headmen with their followers from the district,
and as many of these as arrived he placed under
restraint; setting them to build a stone pier, which
is still standing, though much improved upon. The
townsmen were also forced to assist in this work.
Even Abubakr Basha was employed in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
stones. The pier completed a fort, now demolished,
also a customs-house, were constructed, as a great
trade had sprung up between the town and the
interior; particularly with the town of Harrar, which
now sent ivory, coffee, and slaves in exchange for
the commodities it required, and which were procurable
at Zeila from the many merchants who were
beginning to settle there.</p>

<p>Having organised affairs at Zeila the Basha
marched inland to Gildessa with three hundred
soldiers. My informant says he went there to make
friends with the Galla. Anyway, after he had been
one three months a large steamer landed one thousand
Egyptian soldiers at Zeila. These troops
marched up country and joined the Basha. He
then attacked the Galla. The latter's losses were
heavy, but the Egyptians' could have been none too
light as they were obliged to send for a reinforcement
of five hundred men. Fighting continued for
some months ere the Basha reached and captured
his objective, Harrar. It is stated that after his
arrival in this town he sent for the Amir of Harrar
and caused him to be secretly put to death by having
his neck broken. But the Gallas found out all about
it and were so exasperated that hardly a day passed
without one of the Egyptian soldiers being murdered.</p>

<p>To put an end to such a state of affairs the Basha
ordered two hundred Galla prisoners to be nailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to the ground, crucifix fashion. Over some of these
poor wretches boiling water was poured; then, if
not already dead, they were killed, their heads cut
off and these hung by the ears to a large tree, which,
I am given to understand, survives to this day
outside Harrar. And here ends the story as related
to me by the old man of Zeila.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Abubakr Basha had been employed by
the Egyptians as headman of Zeila, and when they
evacuated the East coast, and the British established
themselves in their stead in 1884, Abubakr was still
living in the town, but died soon afterwards.
Shortly before the evacuation General Gordon passed
through the town on his way to Harrar. He made
a great impression on the people, and is well
remembered by the older people, who take a
special delight in pointing out the house where he
stayed.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing the British thought of was
the suppression of the slave trade, and they took
very thorough steps to this end. In its place they
built up a trade in cloth and natural products, until,
under their regime, Zeila reached the pinnacle of its
prosperity. Had this trade not been with Abyssinia
she would have remained prosperous, but, being so,
other influences crept in and Zeila went under.
After the Egyptians went away Harrar was handed
over to the Amir Abdillahai who was responsible, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
1886, for the massacre of seven Italian gentlemen
with their two servants, members of an Italian commercial
and scientific expedition to Abyssinia. In
1887 Menelik marched on Harrar, met and put to
flight the forces of the Amir some eight miles outside
the town, which has remained in Abyssinian hands
ever since. In 1888 the French landed at Djibouti,
and the fate of Zeila was sealed. By constructing
a railway to Dire Daouwa&mdash;now completed close to
Adas Ababa&mdash;they captured the bulk of the Zeila
trade, which remains in their hands until, perhaps,
some day the spin of fortune's wheel may render
again to Zeila all she has lost.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">GENERAL GORDON'S HOUSE AT ZEILA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The inhabitants are called Zeilawi, and are a
mixed race of Arabs, Gallas, Abyssinians, Somals,
Danakils, Soudanese, and others. They live by
trade, but are gradually falling, like their houses,
into decay. Related by marriage to the Somal
tribes outside the town they have naturally a considerable
influence over them, and lucky is he who
in the old palmy days invested some of his trade
profits in cattle, handing them over to his relations-at-law
to be taken care of.</p>

<p>The first representative of our government was a
consular agent appointed by the government of
India. He built a fort&mdash;now in ruins&mdash;widened the
pier, and made many other improvements. Water
had to be carried from the wells of Tokusha, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
miles away, so a fine masonry tank was built inside
the fort, and in it our water is still stored.</p>

<p>The two Somal tribes coming directly under the
Zeila agency were the Gadabursi and the Issa, both
with "unenviable reputations" for treachery. As
is the Somal custom each tribe is divided into
sections; each section into sub-sections and the
sub-sections are subdivided into <em>rers</em> or families.
The Somal is proud of his pedigree, the average
man being able to rattle off his family tree without
drawing breath, right back to his presumed Arab
ancestors. As a family of four or five brothers may
marry four wives each, as they often do, it follows,
if they band together and have many children, that
quite a new <em>rer</em> or Jilib may be formed. In this
way new and powerful <em>rers</em> spring into existence,
whilst old ones are often wiped out. But the
sections, and in a lesser degree the sub-sections,
rarely change. For this reason the British found it
convenient to continue the Egyptian system of
employing representatives of the various clans, or
families, to act as agents or go-betweens for the
government among their own people. These men
are called Akils, and as, to-day, we have thirty-six
Issa and thirty-seven Gadabursi Akils on the
district books, some idea of the number of clans and
families into which these tribes are divided may be
gathered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The government utilises the system roughly thus:
In Somaliland instead of giving a man's address
you state (<i>a</i>) his tribe, (<i>b</i>) his tribal section, (<i>c</i>) his
sub-section, (<i>d</i>) his <em>rer</em> if necessary. If he is wanted
at court a biladier is sent to fetch him; with the above
information concerning his tribal history no difficulty
will be experienced in finding him, although the
Somals are the most nomadic of people, and
continually on the move. He is as well placed as
Private Brown, of No. 1 Company, 1st Battalion,
fortieth Regiment of General Green's army in the
X Y Z campaign. Sometimes instead of sending a
biladier to call him a wanted man's Akil may be
ordered to produce him.</p>

<p>He may, or may not, refuse to accompany the
biladier. The Akil may, or may not, produce him,
but that does not affect the idea of the system, which
is quite sound in theory and as satisfactory in practice
as may be expected in a wild country like Somaliland.
A biladier is a man employed as a special
constable on any odd job. When sent into the
district to call a man he is given a red ticket, stamped
with the court seal as a badge of authority, and the
meaning of this all Somals know. A man refusing
to accompany him is nearly always caught in the
long run; often when visiting the town in the belief
that the affair has been forgotten and that he is
safe; and, in addition to the matter he was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
wanted for, he has to answer the serious charge of
refusing a biladier.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I sit on the veranda of the government house at
Zeila. I look across at the pier and see, in imagination,
men of many races, whose deeds are chronicled
in the records stored in the office below. Of our
own race Burton and Gordon appeal to me most of
all. But they have gone, the men I am thinking of
who walked along that pier into the town. Gone
years ago, and their bare memory remains. But the
Akils, the biladiers, and the old tribal troubles still
exist. It is of these latter I would speak.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>"ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK"</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The staff&mdash;Office work&mdash;The "Poor Fund" and its distribution&mdash;A
tale of woe&mdash;The D.C. on inspection rounds&mdash;Petitions.</p></blockquote>


<p>The staff at Zeila consists of the District Commissioner,
the District Clerk&mdash;an Indian gentleman&mdash;his
Indian assistant, an Arab clerk and petition
writer, an Indian sub-assistant surgeon, Mahomed
the Somal interpreter, Buralli, or Buralleh, the sub-inspector
of police&mdash;also a Somal&mdash;an Indian
superintendent of customs, and an Arab outdoor
collector of customs fees. There are half a dozen
mounted police, thirty odd foot police, and a round
dozen or so of water police under an Arab jemadar.
Besides these we have many smaller fry, such as conservancy
sweepers, messengers, a lamplighter, etc.,
etc. The Akils I have already spoken of. The foot
police supply or furnish a guard for the jail, which is
under the care of the jail-master, an ex-slave.</p>

<p>There is also a Kathi, or native magistrate, and
an Arab schoolmaster. Further, we boast quite a
number of pensioners, amongst whom are the keeper
of <em>the</em> Sheikhs tomb, and Ferjallah Alone, an old
Soudanese jemadar who accompanied Gordon from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Egypt to Zeila, and subsequently took service in
this country. Ferjallah is very old and feeble, and,
as regards Gordon, most disappointing. To him
Gordon is "Gordon," the greatest soldier that ever
was. "What more than that do you want to know
about him," says Ferjallah.</p>

<p>The D.C.'s office combines the work of treasury,
court-house, post office, administration, tax collection,
and every other public work of the town and
district. It keeps an eye on trade, customs, shipping&mdash;such
as there is (mostly dhows)&mdash;police, prisons,
political and other situations. For all of these the
District Commissioner is directly responsible to
His Excellency the Governor of Somaliland. In
addition he takes an interest in social matters, and
may even, besides being sole guardian and presiding
angel of the "Poor Fund," be called upon to assume
the duties of food controller. Strangely enough he
is not overworked.</p>

<p>Monday morning is usually the busiest time of the
week. Since my arrival here I have arranged on
that morning that all the poor people seeking relief
shall come to the office. Such an arrangement is
looked upon by the scallywags of the town as being
tantamount to an invitation to parade with the
paupers. Not only the scallywags but shameless
old men and women of independent means take the
opportunity&mdash;trusting to luck or an oversight on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
part&mdash;to line up with the crowd and beg for a
four&mdash;anna bit; something for nothing is always worth
acquiring. But there is such a collection of cripples
and genuine "masakins" (poor people), well known
to the police, and ready to eat up our slender fund,
that the impostors stand little chance of getting
anything. Of course, the first thing to be done is
to weed out these latter gentry and send them off
with a word or two of discouragement. Then the
people who have friends, or whose sections belong
to the district, are separated from the absolutely
friendless. The former are assisted to make
representations to their people of their necessity.
Caravans from the interior are approached and asked
to help their tribal brethren. The bush Somals, if
they have any money, often respond to such an
appeal, giving their dole with a pious hope at the
back of their minds that "Rubbama"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> will book it
up against them for the future good of their souls.</p>

<p>And the people who are left are cripples, some
of whom crawl on all fours, frail bent old men and
women, deformed children, the sight of whose
withered twisted limbs and pathetic eyes would
wring the last sixpence from anyone but a hard-hearted
D.C., who is so used to looking at and seeing
these things. Amongst these people we endeavour
to divide, as fairly as possible, the moneys of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
fund. Four annas, fourpence, will fill those empty
stomachs for at least one day, and with care for two.
One need have no fear that the money will go in
drink; such things are not done here. When our
fund is all gone we have a "whip-round" amongst
the merchants of the town, who are, according to
their means, a very charitable lot. Human nature is
human nature all the world over, and who knows but
that the D.C. secretly notes a generous donor as a
man to be helped when the occasion arises. Some
of the subscriptions are consequently very large;
even as much as two or three rupees. Here,
amongst these simple people, one realises that the
Lord loveth a cheerful giver; provided, of course,
that he is an "aggressively" cheerful giver&mdash;otherwise
he might be overlooked.</p>

<p>Unlike other parts of Africa life in Somaliland is
very hard for the poor and indigent, but is not, of
course, comparable with life in Europe. Here, on
the coast, no one is ever cold. The scantiest rags
suffice for clothing, and the sand makes a comfortable
bed. Poor though many of the people are they
will not see a man die of starvation unless by helping
him they are going to suffer themselves. It is
necessary to remember that no ultra-humane, or
excessively sensitive, race could hope to survive in
this country. But there are always to be found
people who seem to be perfectly incapable of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
care of themselves, just as there are people who are
incapable of doing anything else.</p>

<p>The other day a poor tired woman, dressed in
rags, and carrying a child on her back, complained
that she had tramped the interior in a futile attempt
to beg assistance for her child, and blind husband
who was present in court. This old rascal then took
up the tale of woe. He had a brother in the town,
he said, who was perfectly well able to support him,
and he hoped the D.C. would put the matter to the
brother without delay.</p>

<p>"What about the woman," I asked. "I hear you
have divorced her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have divorced her, but she is looking after
me as I am blind."</p>

<p>"And is this your child?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old man who was not really
blind.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall send for your brother, and meanwhile,
as the woman is carrying this child and is tired
out, you can have a rupee to buy food."</p>

<p>The couple then left the court.</p>

<p>The following day the woman reappeared to complain
she was starving and tired out.</p>

<p>"I've carried this child for hundreds of miles. I
am its mother, but I'm so tired I can't carry it
any more&mdash;never again."</p>

<p>"But you had a rupee yesterday to buy food."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you expect me to get anything out of that?"
she said. "I am used to getting nothing. The man
took the rupee and spent it on himself."</p>

<p>We sent at once for the man. Sure enough he
had given the woman nothing at all. She had been
divorced, he said, and was entitled to nothing from
him.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;very well&mdash;if that is your explanation you
can look after yourself in future. Your brother who
can afford to do so will pay the woman a few rupees
each month for the maintenance of your child. As
for you, make your own arrangements."</p>

<p>And so it was.</p>

<p>But to return to the day's work. We are early
risers, and six o'clock every morning finds the people
astir. After a cup of tea I commence the day by
walking round the town. Just now we have an
Indian superintendent of public works engaged in
repairing buildings, and transforming an old police-lines
into a hospital. There is a sum of money
allotted for the completion of each piece of work, and
this amount must on no account be exceeded. It
behoves one to keep both eyes open that this latter
proviso is not lost sight of. From the superintendent
I wander through the streets and note that the
sweepers are doing their work in keeping the
town clean. If the environments of a house are
found to be in a filthy state&mdash;this happens seldom&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
just say: "Tell the owner to come to the office."
This means that he is "for it" later on in the day.
We do not argue about such matters in the street.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 454px;"><a name="STREET" id="STREET"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_029fp.jpg" width="454" height="600" alt="STREET" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A STREET IN ZEILA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I generally visit the pier last of all, and anxiously
look to see if the sea is attacking its foundations in
any way. The D.C. is responsible for the pier, and
there is always something going wrong with it. At
present one Indian merchant has several thousand
bags of salt stacked at one end, and I am in terror
that this great weight will cause the foundations to
collapse. When interviewed the merchant is always
trying to do something about it, and something else
is preventing him from doing it. He is undefeatable.
I can only hope that when a big sea comes it will
wash away the salt without doing any further damage.</p>

<p>Breakfast time comes at eight or eight-thirty
o'clock, and at nine, sometimes earlier, one is in the
office. First of all the cases come on. Divorce and
matrimonial affairs are, as a rule, after a preliminary
hearing, sent to the Kathi; but the aftermath of all
such cases, such as the failure to pay mehr, or maintenance,
is always cleared up by the poor D.C.
Other cases are of a great variety, comprising
political, civil, and criminal matters. There are
also many petitions. Probably the contractor who
controls the meat market complains that he cannot
carry on any longer unless the dues payable by him
to government are reduced. He is really the market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
master, and recoups himself for the expenses
incurred by charging the butchers a small fee for
each animal killed and sold. This man makes as
much fuss over the small fee he is called on to pay
as if it were millions of rupees instead of tens.
Therefore, we must check the animals slaughtered
daily, over a given period, to enable us to compare
his receipts with the fees we collect, plus his other
expenditure. We do not take his word; we send
our own man to collect these figures.</p>

<p>Then there are other petitions. One such from
the daughter of a deceased pensioner, describing
herself as a lone woman, lies before me as I write.
"I am a poor orphan and have no one to turn to but
God and your honour; I pray that you will assist
me and I will always pray for your long life and
prosperity." Rather overwhelming, but one reads
that sort of thing without a quiver of the eyelid.
Here is my note under the petition: "Petitioner is
a good character; the daughter of a sepoy who
accompanied Ferjallah Alone on General Gordon's
escort from Egypt to Zeila. She makes a living by
selling cakes of bread in the bazaar."</p>

<p>The petitions attended to, the District Clerk calls
for some attention. The customs receipts have
arrived and must be checked and locked away in the
safe. A receipt is then signed for the amount and
the peon goes off. After this, if the cases are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
finished, miscellaneous work is attended to, such as
the issuing of passes to natives desirous of visiting
Aden or other places; the settling of applications
for leave from police and other matters. In the
afternoon correspondence is attended to, and last
of all the balance shown in the cash book is compared
with the cash actually in the safe. If the two
amounts agree I sign the cash book. The last day
of the month is pay day, and as I dole the wages
out, an old man, who lives like a hermit on all other
days at Sheikh Amar's tomb near my house, comes
to the window grating and literally howls for pice.
I shall never give that old humbug a pie.</p>

<p>After office hours one inspects the jail and arranges
for the release of time-expired prisoners. We have
no long sentence men so this happens frequently.
Afterwards a long walk or a game of hockey or football:
then home, a bath, dinner, and a lonely evening.
To-night I occupied myself by writing this very
imperfect account of how the days are filled. Of
the cases one tries more anon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>PERSONAGES</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Mahomed the Interpreter&mdash;Mahomed as magistrate&mdash;Mahomed
as author&mdash;Mahomed's reason for Ramathan&mdash;Mahomed as
fighting man&mdash;Buralli Robleh, policeman and gentleman&mdash;Buralli's
domestic affairs&mdash;Mohamed Auwit, petition writer.</p></blockquote>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Mahomed is the court interpreter, a personage of
considerable importance and would-be dignity. In
spite of a decidedly perverse sense of proportion,
leading him at times to confuse the duties of interpreter
with those of magistrate, he is not a bad
fellow. He has certain peculiarities and some
aggravating ways, all of which I readily condone by
admitting that Mahomed means well. But though
meaning well a man may still do badly, and I suspect
that our Mahomed is not the tremendous success he
imagines himself to be. The day may come&mdash;though
I doubt it&mdash;when he will decide to discard
the turban for a hat, in which case, should he find
one large enough to fit his head, and if by any chance
there lies within his nature a spark of humour capable
of asserting itself, the great Mahomed will become
quite a human, lovable character.</p>

<p>I have learned much from him; among other
things the respect and honour due to a court interpreter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Upon these points my education, I regret to
say, had been sadly neglected, but Mahomed has
done his best. My first mistake was regrettable.
I had occasion to interview an Indian shopkeeper.
Mahomed was not present, and I did not send for
him. I plead in self-defence that the matter was
trivial, but, later on in the day, Mahomed pointed
out what a serious thing it would be if magistrates
were allowed to glean information through other than
the official channel, the interpreter. I felt that to
apologise, as I should like to have done, would show
Mahomed how deeply ashamed I was of myself, and,
that out of consideration for my feelings, he might
never reprimand me again. But I wanted to learn.</p>

<p>An occasion arose for him to speak to me a second
time. Mahomed was trying a case in his official
capacity as interpreter, I was assisting in mine of
magistrate. An old Arab had died, leaving some
property to be divided amongst several sons; as yet
this had not been done; the property was in charge
of the deceased's brother and stored in his house.
One of the heirs was in a hurry to pouch his share,
and removed a hubble-bubble without mentioning
the matter to the others. He was ordered to return
it, and to wait until a proper distribution of the
property could be made. But the fellow was a bad
lot; he broke into his uncle's house and stole a
beautifully carved old bed, and some mats. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
examining a witness, concerning this theft, who had
apparently contradicted herself. It was all about the
bed&mdash;these people know everything concerning one
another's beds, which are heirlooms. The woman
giving evidence stated, in the first instance, that the
bed produced in court had been given to the accused's
aunt by her father-in-law as a wedding present.
The father-in-law was the accused's grandfather.
Further on in her statement the witness said it had
been given to the accused's aunt by a woman. I
asked her, through Mahomed, to explain the discrepancy.
Mahomed refused to put the question.
It was quite unnecessary, he said. He knew the
woman referred to was the accused's grandmother,
and the bed was a joint present from her and her
husband&mdash;quite simple.</p>

<p>"But," I said quietly, "I should like the witness,
who is on oath, to tell me that, not you. Please put
my question!"</p>

<p>"But I have already explained to you, it is quite
unnecessary to ask the woman!"</p>

<p>I insisted.</p>

<p>Mahomed turned to the inspector of police and
said in aggrieved tones, "The Sahib doubts my
word. It is useless my interpreting in this court."</p>

<p>I felt that on this occasion I must apologise. I
cleared the court and asked Mahomed to stand in
the prisoner's cage so that he could hear every word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I said. I told him how sorry I was&mdash;for him. He
accepted my apology. He begged that I would
not give the matter another thought, that I would
forget all about it. He realised that his reputation
would suffer if people knew how badly I had been
trained at his hands. To save his reputation I
agreed to push my apology no further. But I know
Mahomed will not trouble to teach me any more. I
am hopeless.</p>

<p>Mahomed has written a book. He told me so
himself. Later on in the conversation he said that
he had written it in collaboration with a European
Sahib. He told the Sahib the names of all the
insects and animals in Somaliland, the Sahib wrote
them down, and they are in the book.</p>

<p>Mahomed has psychic powers. I asked him the
other day why he, and all good Mahomedans, fasted
during the month of Ramathan. He did not know.
I expressed surprise. Up to that moment I believed
Mahomed knew everything. He said he would find
out and let me know, as he was sure my version of
the origin of the fast was a wrong one. That evening
he came to me and said that, during his midday's
siesta, it had come to him in a dream why he and
his friends fasted. When Adam eat the apple in
the garden of Eden it disagreed with him; it was a
green apple and stayed in his belly. Mahomed
never uses other than good old English words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
When Adam went to heaven he fasted for a month,
at the end of which time the apple was digested.
That is why all good Mahomedans fast at Ramathan&mdash;according
to Mahomed's vision. I advised him to
write another book; it would be interesting.</p>

<p>But I have said Mahomed is not a bad fellow. I
really meant that. I have only been depicting a
type, taking Mahomed as a sample, Mahomed the
interpreter. Mahomed the private individual holds
testimonials of faithful service, rendered over long
periods to European masters, that any man might
well be proud to hold. Once, when he was very
young, in the fight against the Mad Mullah at Erego,
he was placed in charge of the camel carrying the
British officers' water chaguls. In the course of the
action he and the camel got into a very warm corner,
and the poor camel lost its life. Mahomed was only
a servant, but he removed a couple of water bags
from the corpse, together with a bottle of whisky
someone had stowed away in the pack, and made his
way back to the British line, where, sitting under a
tree, he found his thirsty master and some friends.
To them he quietly presented the water and whisky
he had risked his life to bring them. Of course they
were grateful, but that was a long, long time ago,
and most of the officers who sat under that tree are
dead. I wonder if those who are alive still remember
Mahomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>A human head sculptured from a block of Welsh
slate, an exact miniature replica of a sphinx, and
you have sub-inspector of police, Buralli Robleh,
to the life. Inscrutable but kindly; gentlemanly,
with just a touch of fire to warn careless people that
he is not a man to be played with. Buralli is one of
the most likeable natives I have met in Zeila. For
thirty years he has served the government faithfully
and well, and the general impression is that even
when he be retired on pension he will continue so
to serve. He is the terror of all criminals, and the
despair of people who intrigue. He sees that the
caravans, as they approach the town, are not
besieged by a crowd of howling brokers and their
satellites, but are allowed to enter the market-place
in peace; that the police are doing their duty, and
that their lines and equipment are kept clean; that
the D.C. hears the other side of the story as opposed
to that presented by careless and lazy Akils. He
knows the private history of all the litigants who
appear in the District Court, and whether they are
trying to bring up a claim that has been tried fourteen
years ago. He knows whether the poor woman
in rags, pleading for a rupee to buy food for her
starving child, is what she seems to be, or a humbug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
who is quite well off. Rarely does he give an
opinion until asked, more rarely still is that opinion
challenged, and never on the ground that it is not
an honest opinion. During his service Buralli has
served under many Sahibs, some of whom are now
famous men; and Buralli has learned much, among
other things the psychology of the Sahib.</p>

<p>He is not a detective; criminal investigation is
not in his line; but the prevention of crime is. Yet
I have heard him confess that, under certain circumstances,
he is prepared to break the law himself.
These were the circumstances. Last night a man
returning home at midnight found a stranger in his
house talking to his wife. He beat the trespasser on
the head with a stick, and was arrested by Buralli.
Buralli pressed his case hard. "Unless you punish
this man, Sahib, there will be trouble between his
section and the injured man's section!"</p>

<p>"Buralli," I said, "had you been in the accused's
place what would you have done?"</p>

<p>"I should have put my knife into the other
fellow," said Buralli, "but, had I done so, I should
have deserved punishment."</p>

<p>To-day a mail arrived bringing a circular instructing
the sons of all Somal notabilities desirous of
undergoing a course of instruction at Gordon
College, Khartoum, to present themselves at
Berbera, not later than the end of the month, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
examination as to fitness for selection. The only
candidate in this district is Buralli's eldest son.</p>

<p>"Better get that boy away at once, Buralli," I
said, "or he will be too late."</p>

<p>"He must wait," said Buralli.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you wish him to go?"</p>

<p>"Ha, Sahib, I wish him to go more than anything
else in the world, but his mother is very ill. She
is deeply attached to the boy, and it would upset her
to part with him just now. When she is a little
better I shall tell her, and the boy can go."</p>

<p>And, do you know, I believe Buralli is deeply
attached to his sick wife. He is the first Somal I
have ever met who could show such tender consideration
for a woman.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Mahomed Auwit, Arab, is the court petition
writer. The son of an influential Arab resident of
Aden, who died many years ago leaving Mahomed a
handsome legacy. He belongs to the upper ten of
Zeila society. Rumour has it that the residuum of
Mahomed's legacy is buried in the floor of his house.
He is a scholar, and reads and writes not only
Arabic but also English passing well.</p>

<p>It is customary for people with a plaint to engage
the services of Mahomed to write it all down in
English, in what is called a petition. The defendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and plaintiff in the same case may each write a petition,
which is handed up, with the other documents,
when the case comes on for trial. A very excellent
plan, giving the magistrate some idea of what the
dispute is all about. Mahomed is a past master at
writing petitions, and some of his epistles might well
have been taken straight out of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>He is a most estimable, unassuming character,
wears glasses, has a pronounced stoop, and in
appearance is not at all unlike a tall thin old woman
with a large nose, dressed only in a turban, her nightdress,
and a pair of sandals.</p>

<p>Mahomed the interpreter, Buralli, and Mahomed
Auwit are the three most important personages in
Zeila district court.</p>

<h3>COURT WORK</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Court opens&mdash;Sultan Mahomed Haji Dideh&mdash;Petitions&mdash;A
case of "being found out"&mdash;Gambling&mdash;Mr Gandhi.</p></blockquote>


<p>As I enter the office there is a slight commotion:
Buralli, Mahomed the interpreter, and Mahomed
Auwit have already arrived, and hurry from the desk
of the last named to bid me good morning. We are
a polite community. Mahomed Auwit has practically
finished his morning's work, as a small pile of
petitions prepared by his hand, and placed ready in
my basket, testify. When I have taken my seat
Buralli informs me that the Sultan of Zeila is waiting
to be received. I assent, and a fine old grey-beard
is ushered in. His feet are innocent of shoes or
sandals, but his cotton shirt and pantaloons are spotlessly
clean. A pleasant intelligent looking man is
my mental note. He fumbles with a bundle of
papers, from which he extracts one and hands it
to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sultan Mahomed Haji Dideh," I read, "was
born at Zeila, and is not in a sound state of mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
He is under the delusion that he is king of all the
kings. His dominions, he says, extend even beyond
the limits of this earthly planet.</p>

<p class="sig">
"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Isher Dass</span>,<br />
"<i>Sub-assistant Surgeon</i>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>What can I do for you I asked the old man.
Buralli explains that the Sultan sometimes visits the
custom-house on an imaginary tour of inspection.
As a rule Harrichand, the customs superintendent,
is very good natured and puts up with the old man's
nonsense. This morning Harrichand was busy, and
when the Sultan called could spare him no time and
became cross. Sultan Mahomed Haji Dideh was
summarily ejected onto the street.</p>

<p>Concerning this insubordinate conduct on the part
of one of his officers the old man is here now to
complain. I look round the court for inspiration.
A crowd has collected near the door hoping to hear
the old fellow baited. He himself looks so dignified,
so like what he professes to be, that I have not the
heart to hurt his feelings. I seize his certificate of
insanity, copy it, and hand it back, saying that I have
made a note of his complaint, and that it will be
attended to. The Sultan is sane enough to realise
there is nothing to be gained by prolonging the interview;
he accepts his paper, bows condescendingly,
and, turning about, struts majestically out of court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>I turn to the petitions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I most humbly beg to state," I read, "that one
Abokr Fahia of the Gadabursi, Abrian, had looted a
pregnant she-camel from Wais Kurmaneh of the
Issa Rer Kul. And then, instead of this she-camel,
Issa Rer Kul had taken a camel from Abokr Fahia.
Now the Gadabursi Abrian want their camel from
the Issa Rer Kul and do not wish to settle the claim
of the she-camel Issa Rer Kul. I therefore pray
your honour to order him, Akil Wairreh Yunis, who
filed the complaint, to restore the camel of the Issa
Rer Kul. By doing me this act of kindness I shall
ever remain grateful. Signed, Hersi Ahamed, his
mark, of the Issa Rer Kul."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now Wairreh Yunis is the Akil of the Abrian
section of the Gadabursi tribe, and Hersi Ahamed is
the Akil of the Rer Kul Issa tribe. In Political
Case No. 17, of 1918, judgment was given against
the Rer Kul in favour of the Abrian for two camels,
one of which had been paid according to the Abrian
statement, and the other remained as yet unsettled
for. This camel Wairreh Yunis was now demanding,
and Hersi Ahamed in his petition pleaded it was
paid for by one camel owed to the Rer Kul by the
Abrian. Rather confusing but that was what was
meant. It will be observed in the petition above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that the camel taken from Wais Kurmaneh is
described as having been pregnant.</p>

<p>When case No. 17, of 1918, was heard neither
Hersi Ahamed nor Wais Kurmaneh attended to
defend it, hence judgment was given against them
in default. The present case, numbered sixty-seven
of 1919, however, brought some facts to light concerning
this old case. It would be hopeless to
attempt to write down the tortuous statements made
by the various witnesses, and the following is what
we arrived at, after sifting the evidence, as a correct
appreciation of the origin of the dispute.</p>

<p>Last year drought conditions obtained in Somaliland,
and many people, among others Abokr Fahia,
were hard put to it to procure food. All Abokr's
milk camels were dry, and it was a case of having to
slaughter an animal. His choice fell on Wais Kurmaneh's
she-camel, which he looted and killed. He
does not attempt to deny that he looted this camel,
but he denies it was pregnant. Wais Kurmaneh
says it was, but how is he going to prove it; the
camel is dead. When the latter found out what had
happened to his she-camel he lay in wait near Abokr
Fahia's kurria until a favourable opportunity presented
itself, when he looted one of his she-camels
in revenge. But this camel he did not kill, and,
shortly after he had seized it, it gave birth to a baby
camel; therefore the Gadabursi claim that the Rer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Kul man looted two camels from their man and must
return the baby, which they have claimed for as one
camel. They consider they hold a strong position
as the original camel looted being dead (and dead
camels tell no tales) it cannot be proved to have been
pregnant.</p>

<p>But their reasoning is not my reasoning. They
find it hard to explain why they hid the true facts of
the case a year ago, and neglected to explain, until
it was dragged out of them, that the whole case was
trumped up on an affair of cross-looting. Nevertheless
both parties considered they had a <i>bonâ fide</i>
case, and both parties felt aggrieved that they got
nothing out of it all but a sound wigging. Never
mind, better luck next time.</p>

<p>I go through the rest of the petitions; nearly
all claims for ordinary debt, and settled in much
the same way as similar cases are settled in
England. There are the usual petitions from
divorced women for payment of their mehr, or maintenance,
for their children, with a request that the
D.C. will put the screw on, and, as an inducement
to do so, he is assured of the lifelong prayers of the
petitioners in reward.</p>

<p>Buralli has one or two criminal cases to settle. A
small boy about five years old is placed in the dock,
and charged with the theft of two rupees from the
old lady who makes the earthenware pots. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to her the baby prisoner is a desperado of the
deepest dye. Has he not been the cause of her
losing two silver rupees? But when we turn him
upside down, and the stolen money falls with a
jingle on the floor, she says: "He is only a child,
Sahib, let him go." And I let him go. He is
branded for ever, child as he is, as a sneak thief.
Had he waited until he was older, and held up an
old woman on the road with his spear, threatening to
take her life unless she handed over her one and only
camel on which was packed all her worldly possessions,
he would have been regarded as a hero, and
might lord it with the best of his brigand friends in
the mosque or in the town. But now he is only a
thief who stole two rupees, and was arrested by the
police. Decent people will hound him from their
doors. A strange thing, public opinion!</p>

<p>Then comes a "grievous hurt" case. Husband,
wife, and the other man. How the wife fights to
save her reputation. She is prepared to sacrifice her
husband if only that can be spared. But facts are
too strong for her. One after the other they are
uncovered, and shred by shred the woman's reputation
goes, until only rags are left. Yesterday how
highly she held her head, and how disdainfully she
scorned her more unfortunate sisters, whose ranks
she joins to-day. But she fights on, as no queen
ever fought for her crown, until she is forcibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
removed. Her morals have nothing to do with the
present case beyond having provided a provocation
for her husband's offence. And yet, serious as is
the matter for her, she is no worse than hundreds
of the other townswomen. She has only committed
the unpardonable offence of having been found
out.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SCENE OUTSIDE ZEILA COURT-HOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The last case of any importance is one in which
a number of lads are charged with gambling. There
has been a police raid, and the usual paraphernalia
of such cases is produced. A dirty old pack of
cards, some small silver coins, and a number of
coppers. Police Constable No. 13&mdash;unlucky
number, he has a beautiful black eye&mdash;deposes that
he caught the prisoners red-handed, playing cards
in one of the numerous coffee shops in the town;
seized the cards and the coins, and arrested the men.</p>

<p>"And did they come quietly, Constable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib."</p>

<p>"Then whatever on earth has happened to your
eye?"</p>

<p>No answer, and I do not press the question. As
a matter of fact P.C. No. 13 set out last night to
administer a little corporal punishment to his wife.
His wife chastised him instead.</p>

<p>The prisoners plead guilty to playing cards, but
state they were only playing for cups of coffee. That
is an old yarn, and does not go down. Fined one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
rupee each, and cautioned that they will not get off
lightly next time.</p>

<p>And now comes Mr Gandhi, the public
superintendent. His coolies have actually gone
on strike. For what? More pay? No.
for what? More water. Well, Mr Gandhi
can settle this strike by giving them as much
as they want, and hang the expense.</p>

<p>The court work is over; I go to count pick
shovels at the prison, and say "salaam" to the
mean unhappy wretches I have sentenced to
of durance vile.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>THE TWO WIVES</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Indelicate expressions&mdash;The narrative of No. 1&mdash;Interruptions&mdash;The
narrative of No. 2&mdash;Buralli speaks the epilogue.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is a truthful record of a scene that occurred in
my court to-day. If some of the expressions used
are rather indelicate I can only excuse myself for
repeating them on the plea that they are not to be
compared with some other expressions used, but
not repeated. Africans call spades "spades," and
talk without embarrassment about subjects that
are taboo in our drawing-rooms. This morning,
without any warning, two Somal ladies were ushered
into my presence at court. Ushered, did I say?
Rather, two ladies burst into the court dragging
at their tails a squad of perspiring policemen, who
showed signs of having been engaged in an unsuccessful
argument with the women.</p>

<p>The imperturbable Somal sub-inspector of police
guided one woman into the witness-box, the other
into the prisoners' stand.</p>

<p>"Well, madam," said I to the one in the witness-box,
"what is your trouble?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Both women began to shout. Cries of "Silence"
interrupted them, and Buralli, the police inspector,
was able to make a little speech.</p>

<p>"Sahib, these two women have been fighting like
devils. At first I thought the town was afire. We
have put this one in the witness-box to keep them
apart. As sure as they are within reach of one
another they fight like tigers, and attack anyone
attempting to drag them apart. They are both
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Very good. This," pointing my finger at the fat
woman in the prisoners' stand, "is accused No. 1.
This," at the long gaunt woman in the witness-box,
"is accused No. 2. No. 2 will explain what she
means by such outrageous conduct."</p>

<p>Meanwhile No. 1 lets down her petticoat, which
I observe is girded round her loins for other than
peaceful, housekeeping purposes. No. 1, with a
snort and a toss of her head, allowed the petticoat to
fall, and made other adjustments to her dress and
person which enabled me to have a closer look at
her without blushing. No. 2 proceeded with her
story.</p>

<p>"My second last husband died some two years
ago, since when, until a few months ago, I have
been a lone respectable widow. Never a word of
scandal has been breathed against me until to-day.
Four months it is since Ali Hosh began to take an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
interest in me, and asked my hand in marriage. I
refused at first to have anything to do with him, but
he pestered me so, that, for the sake of peace, I
married him. He had already one wife, the woman
present in court, who resented the marriage, and
laid herself out to make my life unbearable. At the
end of one month I was tired of the perpetual
bickering, and begged Ali to divorce me. Though
loath to part with me he saw it was the best thing
to do, and agreed. Three times he renounced me
before witnesses, and I am now a single woman
again. This morning his wife came to my house
and made use of the most shocking language. She
called me a &mdash;&mdash; and many other bad names. I
begged her to go away, but on her making use of
the bad expression I have told you of, for a second
time, in connection with myself&mdash;Me! Me! Me! a
most respectable woman&mdash;I lost my temper and
sailed into her in fine style. I made use of no bad
language whatever, and I am at a loss to understand
why I have been arrested. I wish you to realise I
am the complainant in this case. I demand that this
woman be sent to chowky.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She is a bad woman,
ripe for murder, and my life is unsafe whilst she is
at large. What's the use of the British government
if it can be flouted by one fat old woman like this!"</p>

<p>Further remarks of accused No. 2 were interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
by a perfect howl of vituperation from No. 1.
Feminine flesh and blood could not stand such a
remark as the last to pass unchallenged. I quite
understood. There's a time and place for everything.
If I wanted to call a woman "a fat old
thing" I'd wait until she was sailing for Australia
and break it to her gently when the gangway was
up and she was too far from the pier&mdash;on which I'd
be standing&mdash;to jump ashore. Women are really
braver than men.</p>

<p>Shrieks and hysterical screams. "Ha, you
baggage!" "Strumpet yourself; everyone knows
you are no better than you ought to be." Interspersed
with yells from the policemen to the women to hold
their tongues. The row continued: I became quite
excited myself, and joined in the mêlée by beating
on the table with a heavy ruler and shouting out:
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" Buralli closed
this incident by threatening to duck both women in
the sea. I ordered No. 2 to proceed. She repeated
herself again and again. Mahomed the interpreter
gave it as his opinion that she was only wasting my
time. I replied that he was much too fond of
expressing his opinion, and asked him to keep it to
himself. The woman, I said, was to talk until she
was tired out, if I sat there all night to listen to her.
At it she went again until she had to admit there was
nothing more to be said. Meanwhile the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
woman was on the verge of a fit. Whenever she
opened her mouth three policemen shouted into it.
A most effective way of quietening her, but trying
to my nerves. Remember the temperature was
ninety-eight degrees in the shade.</p>

<p>"Accused No. 2! Have you really finished?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib!"</p>

<p>"Bring a Koran and make her swear she has
nothing more to say; and, madam, before you pass
your oath, let me assure you that you cannot, like
Hastings Sahib, stand astounded at your own
moderation. For blasphemous, immodest, immoderate
language I have, in the course of a vast experience,
only once met your equal, and by a strange
coincidence she happens to be accused No. 1. I
would caution you that if, in the depths of your
bowels, there are any bad words or scurrilous statements
left unsaid they had better remain there.
One more word from you and I will send you to jail
for a month without the option of a fine. Now swear
and be careful afterwards to keep your mouth shut!"</p>

<p>She swore.</p>

<p>"Constables! Cast off accused No. 1&mdash;let her
talk!"</p>

<p>And she did talk. It was like a mad woman
praying.</p>

<p>"I have been married to Ali for nineteen years.
Some few months ago he became infatuated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
this objectionable person, and married her. I called
my neighbours and pointed out that Ali was not
earning sufficient money to support me and his two
children, let alone a new wife, a strumpet who was
stealing my husband, and the bread from my
children's mouths."</p>

<p>"Madam," I interrupted, seeing that No. 2 was
on the verge of hysterics, "try and tell your sad
story without calling the other lady names."</p>

<p>"She is everything I have called her and worse,
Sahib. Wait until I tell you her private history!"</p>

<p>"No! no! Please get on with your story."</p>

<p>"She is a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet?"</p>

<p>"And every day before she married Ali, and every
day since he divorced her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Buralli, for God's sake make this awful woman
behave."</p>

<p>Buralli used a few expressions to the lady that I
pretended not to understand, but which secretly gave
me the greatest inward satisfaction. The woman
was actually shocked into getting on with her story.
She proceeded:</p>

<p>"Well, the neighbours talked Ali round. He did
the right thing, and divorced her. Yesterday I
heard he had sent to her for a praying mat. 'What
does he want with a praying mat from her,' I said
to myself; 'I'll go and see about it.' He works in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a little hut beyond the market, and there, sure
enough, I found the mat. I took it away and cut
it into strips. I carried the strips to this woman's
house and I said, 'There's your mat.' I threw the
pieces in her face like this&mdash;I wish they had been
stones. I said to her: 'Take your mat; when my
husband wants a praying mat I'll make him a better
one than you can. When he wants good food I'll
prepare it for him better than you can. When he
wants&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Buralli! Stop her!"</p>

<p>"No, Sahib, who can stop a Somal woman?
Drown her. Murder her&mdash;yes, but as long as she
has breath in her body she'll talk."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I am going to finish this case.
Let her proceed."</p>

<p>On and on she raved. "This is a government
office, and here I hope to get justice from an English
Sahib, etc., etc." At last she was talked out. I
seized my opportunity.</p>

<p>"Do these women live in the same quarter of the
town?"</p>

<p>"No, Sahib, in different quarters."</p>

<p>"Well the order of this court is that they be each
escorted forth from this building by three police
constables to their separate homes. The part of the
town in which accused No. 1 lives is out of bounds
to No. 2, and she enters therein at peril of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
arrested. Vice versâ, the quarter where No. 2
lives is out of bounds to No. 1, and if found there
she will be arrested. Take them out!"</p>

<p>I watched No. 2 being led down the road that
runs straight away from my office door. No. 1 was
escorted across the square to the left. At intervals
the women paused to wave their arms and shout
abuse at one another, but were ever hustled on by
the policemen. At last the stout lady sat on the
road and defied her escort to shift her. They did
not try, and there she sat until her rival was out of
sight, when she arose and went quietly to her home.</p>

<p>"When a Mussulman has been married to one
woman for years," says Buralli, "and then marries
a second wife he has spoiled the first one."</p>

<p>"In this particular instance, which calls forth your
words of wisdom, Buralli, it appears to me that it
was the second wife alone who was in danger of
being spoiled&mdash;by the old wife," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is all right," said Buralli, "she'll marry
again!"</p>

<p>"A bachelor this time, I think, Buralli."</p>

<p>"Sahib," said Mahomed the interpreter, "he was
a wise king who passed the law that a European
gentleman should have only one wife."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was a queen, Mahomed!"</p>

<p>"Sure, it must have been a queen!" said the
wise Mahomed.</p>

<p>From Egypt to the Juba River the whole north-east
African coast is held by three powers, Italy,
France, and England. The Italian colony, now
known as Eritrea, grew from a small settlement at,
or near, Assab, where the Italian flag was hoisted
for the first time in 1879. Excepting that most of
the coast-line in this colony is populated&mdash;in places
very sparsely&mdash;by the Danakil, a tribe closely
resembling the Somal tribe in temperament,
customs, and religion, it has no concern with Somaliland.
The Danakil territory extends as far south
as the Issa Somal's northern grazing grounds, near
Tajura in French territory. From Tajura to almost
the mouth of the Tana River, in British East
Africa, the coast lands, and much of the interior,
are held by the Somals.</p>

<p>In 1888 the Italians turned their attention to
Southern Somaliland, and by 1894 had established
a protectorate over the whole coast between Biaso,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
on the Gulf of Aden, and the mouth of the Juba
River. The Somal tribes south of the mouth of
the Juba, and west of that river, ultimately came
under the jurisdiction of the British East African
government; so that, nowadays, we have, from north
to south, Eritrea, French Somaliland, British
Somaliland, Italian Somaliland, and that part of
East Africa inhabited by Somals and known as
Jubaland.</p>

<p>Somaliland, French, English, and Italian, is
peopled by a race possessed of such peculiar and
contradictory temperamental characteristics, that,
were the accident or influence of environment
entirely ignored, and this people judged by purely
European standards, it might well be classed as a
race of maniacs. To bear out the truth of this
statement is Burton's description of the Somals who
live in the vicinity of Zeila. "In character the Esa
are childish and docile, cunning and deficient in
judgment, kind and fickle, good-humoured and
irascible, warm-hearted and infamous for cruelty and
treachery." This description, which cannot be
contradicted, might well be applied to the whole
Somal race, and it describes a people whose
psychology it is impossible for a European mind,
with no experience of them, to understand and
explain. To the average European, and nearly all
other African tribes, the name of Somal is anathema.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>It follows that Somals are a people who require
very careful handling, and, fortunately for them, the
three powers with whom they are most directly
concerned have followed the more humane method,
when dealing with these brave <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">difficile</i> people, of
interfering as little as possible with native custom&mdash;even
where this custom is sometimes contrary to
European ideas of right&mdash;so long as it affects only
themselves, in preference to an endeavour to enforce
European standards by the employment of
force.</p>

<p>As Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Italians alike
have lost their lives by acts of treachery that can
only be described as the acts of madmen, the lesson
learned has been that, no matter how safe things
may appear on the surface, it is never wise to relax
ordinary precaution. The Somal has no sense of
reverence, if I may use the expression, and considers
himself as good a man, and, like all madmen,
as sane a man as anyone else in the world. One
may expect no supine servility from him, and the
man who looks for it will only find trouble instead.
In dealing with Eastern natives the European is
not unlikely to become somewhat "spoiled," and,
unless he has a very level head, may quite easily
lose a due sense of proportion as to his relative
importance with other peoples in this world.</p>

<p>To-day I received this note from an Indian clerk:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I respectfully request your merciful honour
to arrange for myself and Mr &mdash;&mdash; two riding camels
to go to the garden this Saturday at three p.m.
For which act of kindness we shall be highly
obliged."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course I let him have the camels, and
was thanked so profusely that I began to feel I
was a rather wonderful fellow, and had done something
really magnanimous. But my conceit was
about to receive a rude shock.</p>

<p>Shortly after the camel incident a dirty old Akil
walked into my office, and, with an abrupt "salaam,"
held out a grimy paw for me to shake. I shook.</p>

<p>The old gentleman had come in from the bush to
draw his salary, which I was prepared to pay him
as condescendingly as I had lent camels to the
clerk. It is hard to explain what a pleasant sensation
of exaltation even the most modest of men may
feel when seated on a dais behind a desk, with an
inspector of police&mdash;who bows every time he is
looked at&mdash;on his left; an interpreter on his right,
who would lick his boots for a rise of pay; a clerk who
stands up, and says "Sir" as if he meant it, every
time he is spoken to; and a real live savage in front
of him who has come to ask for pay, and who is an
inferior to whom one can grant favours.</p>

<p>I asked after the Akil's health and his cattle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
endeavouring to convey I was not above taking an
interest in his affairs. Had there been good rain,
and was the grazing good out his way? Was the
political situation quite satisfactory? He answered
all my questions with civility, and after some little
time turned to the interpreter and said: "I've been
nearly thirty years an Akil and this is the first time
I have been asked immediately on arrival in Zeila
for the news of the district. This officer is unlike
the other sahibs."</p>

<p>I took this remark as a great compliment to my
keenness. For there have been some very clever
sahibs stationed here during the past thirty years,
all of whom the old boy before me must have met
and had dealings with. I was so flattered that I
fairly oozed condescension.</p>

<p>"Ask him why I am different to the other sahibs,"
I said.</p>

<p>"You are different to the other sahibs," explained
the old man, "because they knew their work and you
don't know yours. They knew that when a man
comes from the interior he is tired and thirsty. They
gave me my pay immediately I arrived. They did
not keep me standing about answering questions,
but said: 'Here is a rupee bakshish, go and drink
tea with it, and when you are rested and refreshed
come back and tell us all the news.'"</p>

<p>That sort of thing may be very trying, but it <em>does</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
keep one from over-developing a sense of self-importance.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was paid his salary, which he
counted carefully as if he were making sure we had
not cheated him nor given him a bad rupee, then,
with an independent "salaam," and a salute that
might quite easily have been an attempt to brush
a fly off his ear, he went off to drink tea&mdash;at his own
expense! My one miserable score.</p>

<p>That there have been some exciting incidents in
dealing with such people can easily be imagined,
and the following description of one such, that
happened a few years ago to a European, is illustrative
of their treachery. He had left his camp and
escort, and with his orderly had gone to shoot birds.
Having fired away all his cartridges he was returning
to camp, when he met, amongst a party of Somals,
a man who had some petty personal grievance
against him. I shall let him tell the story in his
own words, and, if I may hazard an opinion, he was
a lucky man to live to write the lines I quote.</p>

<p>"In a small clearing, perhaps about a hundred
yards away, we came upon a party of some fifteen
armed Somals who stood directly in our path. For
a moment I hesitated. I was completely unarmed,
and it struck me that these might be hostile. I
questioned my orderly, and he drew my attention
to the fact that an Akil, whom I knew, led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
party. Recognising the Akil I felt reassured,
exchanged with him the salutation of 'peace,' and
stepped forward to shake hands.</p>

<p>"As I did this, and addressed an inquiry in the
vernacular with regard to his health, a man who was
standing behind him drove at me with his spear.
The point took me on the right side of the ribs,
inflicting a bad but not serious wound, while the
force of the blow sent me to my knees. My
assailant still pressed me backwards, and I instinctively
grasped the blade with both hands. My
orderly caught the shaft. The weapon was instantly
withdrawn, lacerating both my hands severely and
slightly grazing that of the orderly. The latter then
passed me my empty shot gun and drew his bilawa.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"All this was the work of a moment. Of what
happened next I have but a hazy recollection. I
lost sight of my orderly, who was doubtless being
attended to. I saw the Akil's face, and it was that
of a man who knew what was afoot. But I was, then,
too busy parrying spear-thrusts to think of anything
else. Finally I got away into the bush."</p>

<p>This incident is one of many that have occurred
to Europeans, French, English, and Italians, aye,
and even Greeks and Russians, in Greater Somaliland.
But few such incidents have ended like this
one, and there have, nearly always, been no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
survivors to tell tales. Such are generally affairs of
a few seconds&mdash;seconds in which death is dealt out
with lightning speed by madmen who are incapable
of counting the cost and consequences of their
deed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>MAHOMED FARA</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">As body servant&mdash;Safari troubles&mdash;Mahomed of the lion's heart&mdash;Mahomed
to the rescue&mdash;The duel&mdash;Mahomed on field
service&mdash;The parting.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is more than twelve years ago now since I first
met him at Adas-Ababa. I wanted a servant, a
strong fellow. Mahomed Fara, Somal, was nineteen
years of age, tall and slender; looked delicate,
and bore traces of having suffered from smallpox;
not enough to disfigure him, for he was a nice
looking boy. He wanted to get out of Abyssinia;
I do not know how he came there. He also wanted
to see the world. I was going on to the Bahr-En-Nil,
which was new country to him, and whether
that was the chief attraction, or whether, as I like to
believe, he had acquired a sneaking regard for my
person, only Mahomed knows, but he asked for the
vacant post. Physically he was far from the type
of man I required, but he had good manners and
impressed me. Looking back on the years that
have passed I know now why Mahomed impressed
me sufficiently to engage him for a trip I feared he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
might not be up to. It was because he was a gentleman
at heart; there was more in him than the good
manners I liked so well.</p>

<p>My impression that he was delicate soon became a
certainty, but the boy had the heart of a lion, and
whatever he turned his hand to was done with the
best that was in him. We had a rough trip.
Crossing the low Abyssinian territory that borders
on the Soudan we found the whole country in flood,
and covered with elephant grass ten to fifteen feet
high. The transport animals could not, and the
transport drivers would not, go on. Somals and
Abyssinians alike put their feet down and said we
were mad to continue. We only replied that, as far
as we were concerned, there was no turning back,
but that if they wished to do so we acquiesced. My
friend, with whom I was travelling, had some Bantu
servants, and a couple of Arabs, who stayed by him,
and of all the others I was left only with Mahomed
Fara. There was no hesitation or doubt on his
part.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to return or will you follow me,
Mahomed? You have a free choice."</p>

<p>"I shall follow you," said Mahomed.</p>

<p>Stores were thrown away and burnt, and our sadly
diminished little party pushed on. What happened
does not greatly concern this story, but, among other
things, we ran short of food, and passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
mostly uninhabited country. It was a miserable
trek, and we were nearly always hungry. Once,
when we met with natives, we purchased dug-out
canoes, and as the country was one mass of waterways
it looked as if our troubles might be nearing an
end. But the canoes were heavy and there was
little current to help them along. Sometimes, when
worn out with the day's paddling and we wished to
camp, not a dry spot could be found for miles and
miles. When we found it it was nearly always
infested with red ants that resented our intrusion,
and made our lives a hell upon earth. When there
were no red ants there were mosquitoes. As we
pushed through the long grass, seeking something
dry to burn, these latter attacked us in swarms.
Then the day came when we were all on edge, and
little unimportant things began to look out of all
proportion to their size. As for Mahomed he was
nearing collapse.</p>

<p>We were paddling down stream, my friend with a
couple of Bantu in one canoe, Mahomed, an Arab,
and I in another. The canoes were almost side by
side, and the Bantus jeeringly called our attention
to Mahomed, who, with closed eyes and limp body,
was automatically dipping his paddle in-and-out of
the water.</p>

<p>I looked at him. When a man has been suffering
pure, unadulterated misery for days and nights on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
end the devils that are in his heart wax strong, and
on the slightest excuse take charge. The sight of
the forlorn, delicate Mahomed, instead of exciting
pity within my breast, made me see red. Why
should my man be flopping about like a dying
duck in a thunderstorm, whilst these other fellows
were still putting their backs into it? It was
disgraceful!</p>

<p>"Curse you, and curse you, and curse you again!
Pull yourself together, you apology for a man, and
try at least to look like one!"</p>

<p>Mahomed was done&mdash;all in&mdash;but there was a
something in the fellow that kept those lean arms
moving spasmodically, and gripped the thin fingers
to the paddle-handle. There was no gallery there
to play to remember. If he had put the paddle down
and said, "I am beaten; I can't go on," nothing
would have happened. But he just carried on.
That there was no change in his attitude annoyed
me, and the Bantus laughed. Then, to my eternal
shame, I sprang forward and struck him; struck him
savagely as I would not strike a horse were it as
tired as he. He did not flinch from the blow, but
just pulled himself together and looked at me. The
incident is twelve years old, but I have never
forgotten that look. When I think of it I feel
as ashamed of myself now as I did when I
faced it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day we camped on a dry piece of ground,
and it was a case of shooting something for the
pot. We had our choice of two varieties of game,
doves and elephant, both with the rifle. There was
no other animal-life fit for food. Mahomed and I
found an elephant standing near an ant heap in
long grass. I could not shoot from the side as the
grass hid the animal when I stood on the ground,
and when I sat on the ant heap his head was at an
angle slightly pointing away from me. The one
shot offering any hope of success was the frontal
head one. This offered but a poor chance of
success, but I wanted to get it over, and decided to
take it. Mahomed stood behind me with a spare
.303, and I, with a .318 in my hand, watched the big
brute swaying on his legs as he dozed in the sun.
On his head lay a great bunch of grass, which now
and then fell to the ground, only to be picked up
in his trunk and sleepily returned to its place as
head-covering.</p>

<p>Then I fired, and as I had feared, the bullet struck
at too great an angle and lodged harmlessly in the
mass of forehead-bone. Then things moved. The
brute saw me: I whipped back the bolt of my
magazine rifle, and, as I pushed it home, the end of
a bandage I was wearing on my hand fouled, with
the inevitable consequence&mdash;a jam. So there I was,
perched on an ant heap, in full view of an infuriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
elephant, who, with uplifted trunk, came to investigate.
The rifle was worse than jammed, because
it was fast to my hand with a bandage that seemed to
have the strength of a hundred ropes. Mahomed
was behind and below with the spare rifle, and
could neither see nor do anything. There was
room for but one man on the heap to which I
stuck, trying frantically to clear my hand. With a
shout of "Hold on," Mahomed reached up, tore clear
the rifle, bandage and all, and passed the .303 just
in time. When it was all over&mdash;it was a matter of
seconds&mdash;I came down and looked at him. Just
looked at him, for I could not speak. Mahomed
Fara looked back and smiled. We were even. In
return for the cowardly blow I had dealt him yesterday
he had, by his coolness and presence of mind,
saved my life. When I did find my tongue I said,
"By God, you are a man," and that closed the
incident between us for ever.</p>

<p>Long afterwards, whilst Mahomed was still my
servant, we met again one of the Bantus who had
laughed at him from the canoe. It was Christmas
day, I remember, but he and Mahomed broke the
peace outside my bungalow. My friend, he of the
canoe, and I ran out together to separate them, but
the native head-man told us we would only delay
matters by interfering. They had to fight until one
was broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let them fight," said my friend, "let them fight
it out."</p>

<p>I looked at Mahomed and saw that he was as thin
and delicate as ever, and, to my mind, it seemed his
nine stone of flesh and blood must be beaten to
pulp by the fourteen stone brute who stood before
him.</p>

<p>"Aye, let us fight it out, Sahib," said Mahomed,
reading my thoughts, "things have gone too far; we
<em>must</em> fight."</p>

<p>"Very well," I reluctantly assented, "but your
blood be on your own head."</p>

<p>As I expected the Bantu simply smothered the
Somal. Although we barred sticks, knives, or stone-throwing
(don't smile, Africans use those things
in preference to bare fists) there were many foul
blows given and received&mdash;more often received by
Mahomed&mdash;until at last the weaker man was in dire
straits. Again and again he staggered to his feet
only to hit the ground immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>"Stop. Give in, Mahomed. He's a better man
physically, and he'll kill you!"</p>

<p>"I shall never give in," replied Mahomed. "He
is a slave and I am his master!"</p>

<p>And then the spirit in him began to triumph over
his adversary, who, though quite unhurt, now showed
signs of fear. Once he fell to the ground, and
seizing Mahomed's leg bit it to the bone. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
act he was rewarded by a kick on the face that gave
him the wished-for excuse to "play possum." The
battered Mahomed now began to kick his adversary
feebly on the body with bare feet, and the latter cried
out to us to save him.</p>

<p>"Admit you are beaten!" said Mahomed.</p>

<p>"I am beaten!" said the Bantu.</p>

<p>Afterwards I married. The change of life from
the single to the blessed state affects not only the
European dweller in Africa, but also his servant.
Where a wipe here and a flick there with a duster, in
the old days, constituted tidying up the house, everything
now must be cleaned and polished with
scrupulous care. There are also ever so many
things that were never done in the old times more
than twice a year&mdash;and that a record year&mdash;that now
call for attention every day. A bachelor's servants
rarely remain long with him after he marries. But
Mahomed was one of the exceptions. When the
first baby came he was as delighted as I, and when
others followed he seemed to share the heavy cares
of family life equally with me. I can pay him the
greatest compliment a white man can pay the native.
Wherever the children might be I felt that if
Mahomed were there, and alive, they were safe.
His own marriage to an older woman was unhappy,
and one day, yielding to her importunities, he
allowed her to go. She left him a young son. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mother had been rendered destitute as the outcome
of a wild raid by the Mad Mullah, and Mahomed
brought her, and a young brother, to Jubaland,
where we lived. I had then an opportunity of learning
that he was a good son.</p>

<p>When war broke out in August, 1914, Mahomed
and I, for the first few days, took little heed.
We were too far removed from the European
world to realise what was coming. But, soon
afterwards, I left Mahomed to help bring up the
children, whilst I went off to join the King's African
Rifles.</p>

<p>Later it was so arranged, by collusion with <em>someone</em>
who ought not to have been so unselfish, that
he might again taste the joys and discomforts of the
old wild free life on the veldt. So Mahomed came
to be my servant in the M.I. Wherever I went he
followed, though he was cautioned again and again
that his duty was with the horses, or in the column,
and not in following me round like a dog, even to the
firing line. M.I. work in the early days of the
G.E.A. campaign was more than exciting, and the
men could not understand why Mahomed never
failed to accompany them if he had the chance,
instead of staying behind with the crowd. But we
had a secret, he and I. It was something about a
letter that had to be delivered by him under certain
contingencies; contingencies that occurred in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
careers of many good men, alas, only too often in
those days.</p>

<p>Then, one day in March, 1915, at Mwaika Hill
in German East Africa, the M.I. ran right into it.
For five minutes it was touch and go. I was commanding
Somals, and it was the first doubtful corner
we had been in together. I was not sure of them for
the moment. Let me hasten to say that I am now,
sure of, and proud to have commanded them. But
on that occasion we were a bit mixed, just a little in
the air, and it was vital that we should hold a bad
position whilst the column behind deployed for
action. There were swarms of bullets about, and I
had a suspicion that, mixed up as we were with the
Hun askaris, some of those same bullets were coming
from our own side. I had joined in a short rush, and
was lying ready to order another, when someone
came with a run and threw himself beside me. It
was Mahomed, and a fine old storm of bullets he
brought with him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Mahomed? You
ought to be back at the horses."</p>

<p>"Sahib, I promised the Mem-Sahib to look after
you, and I've come to warn you that you are not
taking cover properly. These people are shooting
straight and shooting to kill the officers. It is foolish
for you to keep moving about. Please take cover
properly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, now you are here at the Mem-Sahib's
orders, do you think you can do anything? Can you
catch one of these bullets in your hand? It is you
who are foolish."</p>

<p>But all the same after that warning I was more
careful to take cover.</p>

<p>We were sending back for ammunition, and
Mahomed was told off to accompany the messenger,
more to get him out of danger than anything else.
But the messenger was killed on the way, and,
meanwhile, we were relieved, and received orders to
get back to the horses and mount. On our way we
met Mahomed again, returning with an ammunition
mule whose syce had also been killed; and it seemed
to him as if the German and British forces had
combined to pick him off, and the wretched mule with
him. He had been "through it," and there was a
look on his face that reminded me of the day I had
struck him on the river. Two men relieved him
of his charge, and we dragged the disobedient
Mahomed back with us, the men keeping an eye on
him to see that he ran into no further danger. He
was not a soldier, but he was out to risk his life to
keep a promise he had made to the Mem-Sahib, and
no one would want to accuse him of being a medal-hunter
for doing it.</p>

<p>Then Mahomed and I parted, and it was a great
breaking-up. The kiddies to England, and he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I missed one another, and did not meet again for
more than two years. It was just luck. After the
armistice I was on my way home, and, as the train
was about to pull out of Nairobi station, we met
again. Mahomed hurried on to the platform with
a basket of fruit, for he had heard I was ill. He
jumped into the carriage, and in a few seconds had
arranged my few belongings comfortably. It was a
kindly thought, that little service, and worth to me
more than the gift of fruit. The memory of it is
still sweet. Mahomed, even in the stress and rush
of a railway parting, where he had to stand back
whilst I spoke to more important people than
him, could find pleasure in doing little things for
his old master. He had a long memory, had
Mahomed.</p>

<p>"If you return I wish to enter your service
again," he said, when I had time to give him a
moment.</p>

<p>"You are a millionaire now, Mahomed. You are
drawing exactly twice the pay I can afford to give
you."</p>

<p>"Never mind that; I want to come back on the
old pay."</p>

<p>But Mahomed and I are getting on in life, and
he has responsibilities. I could not permit him to
make such a sacrifice, and so we parted.</p>

<p>Such is the tale of Mahomed Fara, Mahomed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Somal. I do not deny that there were occasions when
he kicked over the traces; that he had within him
the wild strain of his breed responsive to injury, real
or imagined, even as a barrel of gunpowder to a
red-hot poker. But I have just pictured him as I
found him, and, although he is black and I am white,
I am proud to call him "friend."</p>

<h3>COMMERCE</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Trade sources and commodities&mdash;A typical manifest&mdash;The old
Jew goldsmith.</p></blockquote>


<p>I call this chapter commerce. Not the commerce
so dryly described in the mass of Zeila tabulated
customs' returns that lie before me on the desk as I
write. Into these figures, at a first glance, it would
seem almost impossible to weave the slightest
suspicion of adventure or romance. Yet the pursuit
of our trade is not without adventure; often adventure
of the good old-fashioned kind&mdash;well spiced with
danger. But the main, and practically the only,
industry of Somaliland is cattle raising, unless one
includes the pursuit of war as an industry. If so it
is a dying one. With the proceeds of the sale of
his surplus cattle the Somal buys goods from all
parts of the world. Cloth from America, Europe,
Arabia, and India; bowls and other knick-knacks
from Japan; the bulk, or all, of which comes to him
through the great clearing house of the near east,
Aden.</p>

<p>Although a couple of small coastal steamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
owned by an Aden firm visit our port at stated
intervals, most of our sea-borne trade is carried in the
holds of dhows. The Zeila fleet is not a large one,
and plies between the comparatively near ports of
Berbera, Aden, Jibouti, Perim, towns on the Arabian
coast; Assab, an Italian port in the Red Sea, and
several other unimportant places. From Assab
come mats for covering the huts and tents; string,
and the leaf of the doum palm. This latter the
women of Zeila plait in their spare time, as our
women do knitting, into long flat strips, which are
afterwards sewn into bags and mats. But the best
mat grass comes from Berbera, and I have one mat
plaited from this grass which is truly a work of art.
Interwoven with the plaited grass are thin strips of
red and blue cloth, forming a diamond pattern of
tasteful design; the result being an article that
pleases the most fastidious eye.</p>

<p>Apart from cloth, dates, rice, and sugar are our
chief imports. Dates are a splendid and highly
nutritious food, eaten daily if procurable. They
come to us from Mokulla, Muscat, and Basra, and
are, more often than not, transhipped at Aden. But
our dhows are enterprising craft and go a-trading
themselves. Here is the manifest of one that
arrived home to-day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"Dhow Fathal Kheir, Master Said Musa; cargo:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="cargo">
<tr><td align="right">250</td><td align="left">packages of dates</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">30</td><td align="left">bags of lime</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2</td><td align="left">bundles of mat bags</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1</td><td align="left">package of sweets</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">6</td><td align="left">bundles of coir rope</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" colspan="2">&mdash;all from Mokulla."</td></tr>
</table></div>
</blockquote>

<p>From Basra come, in addition to the dates, grain,
carpets, and sweetmeats, the latter being the well-known
Turkish delight. The carpets are disappointing,
and it is to be feared that, though they actually
come from Basra, the majority are made in Europe.
I have only been able to secure one drugget of
undoubtedly eastern manufacture, but it is so fiercely
coloured that it will swear at everything in a civilised
room. In the old days real, genuine carpets found
their way here from Basra, and other ports. I have
seen one such, though over fifty years of age, whose
colours are as bright and fresh now as on the day
it was made.</p>

<p>The dhows bring all sorts of delightful things to
gladden the heart of the European collector. I
picked up two lovely old brass-bound chests made
from a rich black wood, finely carved by a delicate
hand. None of your barbarous eastern designs. I
have seen many old chests, but these of mine are,
in my opinion, incomparable. They are to me a
perfect joy, but can only be described by an artist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and I am not one. Sometimes I turn the massive
brass key of one, and throw open the lid, when the
faintest and most delicate smell of incense steals
forth to tell how, long before these boxes came
into my hands, they were used by Arab ladies
to store their delicate silks and fripperies. What
is their history? I know not. I was lucky to
acquire them, for the old Arab families rarely part
with such heirlooms, for heirlooms they are, or
were.</p>

<p>And then, sometimes, one finds the most wonderful
old pottery. Plates that the old Arab grandmothers,
years ago, hung upon their walls for
ornament, and, incidentally, to prove their very good
taste. That these people do have good taste, and
some cultivation, is shown by their high appreciation
of such articles, all of which came to our shores in
the dhow holds. Who dares to say that our commerce
has not its spice of romance?</p>

<p>Of our exports skins are the most important.
Horned cattle come next. From Abyssinia has been
known to come, in one consignment, ivory, coffee,
and civet. The coffee is from Harrar; famous for
its long berry and delicate flavour. For the latter
quality I can vouch. My cook buys the berries at
eightpence the pound and has them roasted and
ground by a woman expert in the town. Gums and
frankincense, gathered from the wild trees, are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
valuable products that find their way hither in small
parcels, hidden among the camel loads of grain
and skins. Large caravans of the "ships of the
desert" enter the town daily, and many are the
stories of "loots" and wild doings they report of
the hinterland through which they have passed.
With the exception of a little of the coffee,
incense, ghee (rancid butter), and grain, this latter
from Abyssinia, all they bring goes to the dhows
for export.</p>

<p>The incense is used by Somal and all Mahomedan
women to perfume themselves. A small earthenware
brazier is filled with burning charcoal, on which
is sprinkled the incense. Over the brazier the lady
stands, covering it and the smoke with her petticoat,
should she wear one, or the sheet-like robe that
drapes her body. As a result she is well fumigated,
and if, afterwards, to the European nostrils she
exhales a sickly smell of stale incense what matters
it; for European prejudices she cares but little, and
her husband has, I regret to state, an abominable
taste in scents, and thinks she smells fine. Perhaps
she does.</p>

<p>In our town the manufactures are few but
interesting. There is the old Midgan woman who
makes the earthenware pots and water ewers. She
is a marvel of expertness. With her fingers she will
mould a pot from a piece of mud whilst you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
looking at her. There is no wheel, no model; it is
all done with the fingers alone. A water vessel with
a slender neck appears as if by magic. It is as if
she were making passes in the air with her hands,
and the thing appears like the Indian conjurer's
mango tree. Our pot woman would make her
fortune on a London music-hall stage, and she is
such a friendly soul; her smile is like a tonic.</p>

<p>Then we have iron, silver, and goldsmiths. The
former make knives, daggers, spearheads and
arrowheads for men, and little household utensils for
the women. The silversmiths squat on their mud
floors and mould and hammer out all kinds of
ornaments: silver anklets, chains, bracelets, neck-amulets,
and huge silver beads for the women; silver
rings set with huge moon and other cheap stones,
the bigger the better, for the men. Terrible affairs
these rings, that set one's teeth on edge; but the
other ornaments are well made and not at all
inartistic. The little silver vessels, covered with
filigree work, used to hold the black paint with which
the women accentuate their eyebrows, and the henna
for staining their fingers, always appeal to me. One
silversmith has a box full of every kind of second-hand
ornament. One day I was present when he
turned it out and I pounced upon one of these paint
vessels which he refused to sell. It was in pawn,
as were the other articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The old Jew goldsmith has bars of gold shaped
like small sticks of solder. Pure Abyssinian gold it
is, too. He has old, old dies for making medallions,
the inscriptions on which neither he nor anyone else
in Zeila can read. These medallions, always of
gold, are fashioned with tiny connecting links of
chain into handsome necklaces. How I'd love to
rummage through his boxes, but he is discouraging,
and barely allows me a glimpse of the wonderful old
things he owns, or perhaps holds in trust. He is our
fashionable jeweller, but he, too, squats on his
haunches on the floor to beat out the most beautiful
things with his hammer, on an anvil no bigger than
six inches of steel railway rail. He is anxious that
I should commission him to make a pair of ear-rings
for "Madam." I am to provide pearls and design,
he the gold and craftsmanship. But then I am no
draughtsman, and I am not sure whether "Madam"
would after all appreciate our combined efforts! I
have suggested that we let the matter stand over
until I hear from "Madam," to whom I have referred
it. He says it is a waste of time to wait. "Madam"
is sure to say "Yes," and, if she does, I shall get
good value for my money. If all is as it appears to
be I most certainly shall. A golden trinket, when
completed, he places in one balance of a tiny pair
of scales, and balances it with silver four anna-bits.
For every silver coin in the scale one pays him three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and a half rupees in settlement for the gold; then,
for every rupee you have paid for the gold you add
a quarter rupee for his work&mdash;and the article is
yours ... or "Madam's."</p>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT DHOWS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Timber&mdash;Navigation&mdash;The dhow and the slave trade&mdash;Dhow
captains.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is no good timber on the Somaliland coast.
The wood from which our dhows are built is
imported. By far the best comes from the famous
forests of Witu and Malindi on the British East
African coast. This latter, called Bamba Kofi by
the natives of Witu and Lamu, is nowadays very rare
and worth its weight in gold. The work put into
the dhows is rough and good. There is never any
hurry or rush in their construction, and the only
tools used are the adze, the brace and bit, the saw
and hammer. The boats are painted with the
brightest colours procurable, but at a pinch porpoise
fat and lime make a passable substitute for
paint.</p>

<p>We have no monster craft like the Basra dhow,
carrying two thousand packages of dates, such as
was wrecked off Berbera some years ago. The
biggest boat we have, and we are indeed proud of
her, barely carries her three hundred sacks of rice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and boasts no compass. Her captain does not
require one; he knows the fourteen stars of the hot
season and the fourteen stars of the cold season,
each of which he will tell you is seen for thirteen
days or nights only. As for <span class="smcap">Nut</span> and <span class="smcap">Thuraya</span> in
the cool season, <span class="smcap">Akil</span>, <span class="smcap">Kaleh</span>, <span class="smcap">Shole</span>, <span class="smcap">Suod</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Suhail</span>, though they be of the twenty-eight stars
used by dhow-men to steer by when they are in the
heavens, beware! High winds may be expected.
"And if it is so dark that you cannot see the stars?"
I once asked a dhow captain. "Unless we are
dangerously near to the shore, or there are reefs
about, we just go on. One can't get lost in the
Gulf of Aden."</p>

<p>But often dhows do get lost in the Gulf of Aden;
and I mean it in the literal sense. A few years ago
the Zeila dhow, <i>Sahalla</i>, in charge of an Arab named
Mahomed Hussain, bound from Berbera to Zeila
with mail, a cargo of one hundred bags of jowari
and thirteen passengers from Bulhar, capsized about
four miles out to sea at half-past three of an August
afternoon. Three men and one woman were drowned,
and several persons clinging to a mast were in the
sea for three days. A small boy seized the tail of
a sheep and clung on until the animal dragged him
ashore. As a rule sheep are poor swimmers, but
luckily for the youngster, who could not swim, this
beast was an exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In years gone by Zeila dhows saw exciting service
in the slave trade, but the old dhow captains are
naturally reticent concerning any part they may have
taken in it. Even the ex-slaves, all of whom profess
to be devout Mahomedans, prefer to keep secret,
if possible, the story of their adventures and release.
According to the jail-master, who is one of the latter,
he was nothing but the adopted son of a slave-master,
who spent much of his time in teaching his protégé
the intricacies and mysteries of the true faith. He
holds such a good position nowadays, does our jail-master,
that people are charitable enough to forget
that he was once "only a slave and a heretic."
Human nature is like that.</p>

<p>In the old records, which I am never tired of
reading, there is a copy of a statement, made on oath,
twenty-five years ago by two slaves who made their
escape from an Assab pearling dhow working on
the Arabian coast. In the dead of night they
slipped away with the dhow's one and only boat,
and were lost for days. In the last extremity of
thirst and hunger they made Perim. From thence
a kindly British Resident sent them on to Zeila,
where they told a tale of such brutal ill-treatment at
the hands of their late masters, that it called forth the
practical sympathy of the officer-in-charge, who
helped them in every possible way. One of these
men is dead, and the other has become one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
leading petty traders. It would be considered by
this latter to be the height of bad form to rake up
the old story concerning his past. He likes to think
that the older generation has almost forgotten his
humble origin, and that the younger may in time
come to believe that his children are descended
from one of the old Arab sheikhs, to whom all
respectable Zeilawis are related. I wonder if they
are?</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A NAKHODA (CAPTAIN) AND HIS FAMILY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The dhow captains are ever ready for an adventure,
and, until recently, many came their way.
Towards the end of 1916 a number of German secret
service men, who had been endeavouring to stir up
trouble for the allies by interfering in the politics of
the ex-King of Abyssinia, Lij Yassu, and even of
the Mad Mullah, determined to leave Africa, as fate
was against them. One of these men walked from
Abyssinia, and keeping to the French and British
Somaliland border approached the coast, where he
had arranged with the captain of a dhow to pick him
up and take him to Arabia. But the Zeila and Djibouti
police were on the look out, and acting on "information
received" the dhow was arrested. Shortly
afterwards the despondent German was only too glad
to give himself up at Djibouti. His chance of
escaping to Arabia was hopeless, and he was a lucky
man to have reached the coast alive. Others of his
ilk did not succeed in doing so, and it is on record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that one of them perished miserably of thirst in the
bush.</p>

<p>Nowadays, thanks to the British Navy, slave-running
and gun-running are "industries" of the
past, and the dhow captains, whose hearts are still
unchanged, confine their activities, in the illegitimate
line, to landing a parcel of silk or cloth at night
when the coast is clear. A party of conservancy
sweepers has even been known to find, hidden in
the garbage that strews our beach, a parcel of
firearms landed by some fire-eater who is now
repenting his venture in Berbera jail. The dhow
men unanimously agree that life is becoming
decidedly dull. That it is still sweet is sometimes
brought home to them as they fight their open craft
through the sudden storms that often take them
unawares in these waters; or when, as has been
known to happen, a dhow laden with live stock has
a hole knocked through her bottom by a restless
bullock. The hole has been stopped with the
clothes torn from the backs of the crew, and the
water that found its way in, and threatened to send
all hands to the bottom, bailed out by desperate men
armed with bowls, scoops, cups, and any other
utensil that came to hand. For, be it known, our
Arab and Somal sailormen never dream of danger,
and when danger comes it always finds them unprepared,
but, full of fight whilst they consider there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a chance. When they realise they must face the
worst no vain regrets are wasted on might-have-beens.
They humbly bow the neck to fate, and,
like their fathers of old, comfort themselves with
the thought that what is to be will be&mdash;"Inshallah."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT THE SLAVE TRADE</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">British and French pressure&mdash;The general question&mdash;A naval
narrative.</p></blockquote>


<p>But though dhow captains and ex-slaves keep their
mouths shut, the old records, fortunately, tell us
something concerning the slave trade, which, thirty
odd years ago, the British took such effective
measures to stamp out in all territory coming under
their influence. I am speaking of the Red Sea and
Somali coast. Before the French began to make
their presence felt in what is now French Somaliland,
and whilst that territory was still a sort of no man's
land between British territory on the south and
Italian territory on the north, the principal port for
the exportation of slaves was at Tajura on the gulf
of that name, a small Danakil native town north-west
of Djibouti. Danakil territory extends far
north of Tajura along the coast into Italian territory,
past Asab, another small port on the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The trade was in the hands of the Sultan of
Tajura, his friends and a few other influential natives.
These people owned dhows flying the Arab flag,
and were in the habit of running their human cargo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
into the port of Hodeidah. As British pressure was
more and more brought to bear from the south, and
similar Italian pressure from the north, it is easy
to understand that the trade at Tajura increased
greatly, particularly after that port, held for some
time by a small Egyptian garrison, was finally
abandoned by the Egyptian government, thus
removing the slight restraint caused by the necessity
of bribing the Egyptian officials.</p>

<p>But, simultaneously with their effective occupation
of the Southern Danakil coast, stern measures were
taken by the French against the Sultan of Tajura
and his friends, whose activities were, in consequence,
gradually curtailed, and finally forced to
cease altogether. The Italians experienced the
greatest difficulty of all in destroying the trade as
their ports were situated in the Red Sea, and nearer
to the slave markets. Dhows from there ran less
risk of capture than those from the French and
British ports, which had to pass through the straits
of Perim. But the Italians were keenly alive to
this fact, and spared no efforts to stamp out the
nefarious trade.</p>

<p>In regard to the general question&mdash;the best means
of suppressing slavery in this part of Africa, at the
time of which I speak&mdash;the minds of the various
authorities were much concerned, some advocating
one course of procedure, others another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The following narrative by the commander of a
British man-o'-war not only provides a vivid description
of how the work was done, but throws some light
on the horrors of the trade itself. It is headed
"Successful capture of slaves off Moka in the Red
Sea," and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the morning of 16th September, 1888, at
daylight, three dhows were sighted from the ship,
steering to the northward with a fair breeze. The
ship took up a position to cut them off from the shore,
some five miles distant, and having closed them to
about half a mile she hoisted the British flag, and
fired blank charges from her guns as a signal to them
to lower their sails. They paid no attention to the
signals, but separating from each other tried to run
past the ship and get inshore of her. It becoming
evident now that they were slavers, shots were fired
across their bows as a further warning, and they were
hailed also to lower their sails. Their only reply was
a jeering shout, as they were running very fast, and
it appeared as though two at least must escape
capture; but they reckoned without their host, as will
be seen further on.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="GOVERNMENT" id="GOVERNMENT"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_097fp.jpg" width="600" height="368" alt="GOVERNMENT" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A GOVERNMENT CHARTERED DHOW, ZEILA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The ship beat to quarters, and orders were given
to fire at the masts of the dhows. Shots from the
seven inch and the sixty-four prs. passed repeatedly
through their sails, but masts and halyards were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
struck and the dhows held on their courses, rapidly
diminishing the distance between them and the
shore, now only about two miles distant. The order
was then given to open fire with the Gardner guns
in the Tops, at the dhows' poops where the steersman
sits. The effect of the showers of bullets was
instantaneous; the captain of the largest dhow was
killed at once, and, no one caring to take his place
at the helm, she came to the wind and the crew
lowered her sail. An armed boat was sent to take
charge of her.</p>

<p>"The ship then chased No. 2 dhow, who seeing
the first dhow had given in lowered her sail and gave
in also. In the meanwhile No. 3 dhow had got far
away, and an exciting chase took place, the ship
firing from all her guns at every possible chance, the
dhow doing her best to get away; but a lucky hit
brought her to, her captain, being struck while
steering her by a shot from the Gardner gun, sprang
up and fell overboard; she then gave in. While
chasing this dhow, dhow No. 2 had tried to hoist her
sail and get away, but the boat's crew promptly
opened fire on her with their rifles; she then finally
gave in. The crews and owners of the slaves were
then brought on board (thirty-three in number).
These men were in charge of the slaves, but the real
owners are large merchants in Jeddah, Mecca,
Hodeida, and other Turkish ports in the Red Sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
The slaves, two hundred and four in number, were
then brought on board; they were chiefly from the
district of Goojan in Abyssinia; the females
especially seemed to have been well taken care of
as they fetch a high price. The dhows were then
taken in tow and the ship proceeded to Aden.</p>

<p>"The greater part of the rescued slaves were
Christians, amongst whom were some very clean,
tidy, and intelligent girls varying from six to eighteen
years of age. It seems monstrous that they should
be taken to satisfy the lusts of Turkish Mahomedans.
They were all well looked after on board, and seemed
to recognise that they were among friends, for they
were soon laughing and chatting; parties among
them who had been separated in the dhows were
hugging and kissing each other in a very affectionate
manner. Whatever their future may be it cannot
be worse than that from which they have escaped.
A great many Europeans at Aden are offering
to take care of them, and there seems every
chance of the greater part at least having happy
homes."</p></blockquote>

<p>That report was written thirty-one years ago, and
the slave trade is a thing of the past. At least,
just so long as civilised nations continue to hold
and administer this wild country. But the hearts of
the men who are now our subjects are the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of the slavers their fathers, fierce, cruel, and
unchanged. I think the story told by the gallant
sailor is sufficient justification for our coming
here, and for our remaining here. It certainly
convinces me.</p>

<h3>RAMATHAN</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Kharif&mdash;The month of Ramathan&mdash;The Sahib's gift and
others.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is June, the season of the "Kharif"; the Kharif
that has three elements&mdash;wind, dust, and heat.
Zeila sky reminds me, this morning, of a Sheffield
sky, covered at dawn with a pall of yesterday's foul
smoke. The atmosphere is such as that near a huge
furnace whose fires have burned out during the night.
One can still feel the dead heat that will, later, take
on a new, fierce life, as old Sol, then tipping the
eastern horizon with a dull glow, rises higher into
the heavens.</p>

<p>The sea is grey and dull, the dullness of a cooling
mass of molten metal sprinkled with fine ash. Not
the greyness, or dullness, that heralds a change of
weather, but that of tired burned-out nature, waking
unrefreshed from her night's sleep. All night long
Nature has tossed in troubled dreams, and now wakes
to life, haunted by a vague wild feeling of oppression;
an undefinable oppression almost akin to
despair.</p>

<p>There is no bright awakening here, with coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
cheeks and sparkling eyes. The face that nature
turns towards the pitilessness of the new-born day
is drawn and anxious. She is too tired to plead for
mercy; too listless to try anew the thousand wiles that
she alone is mistress of. Here is the stokehold of
the world, and the devils who control it are lighting
the fires.</p>

<p>At midday the town of Zeila is fast asleep, for
this is the month of Ramathan; the month that all
good Mahomedans give up to prayer and fasting.
The average Zeilawi, or Somal, cannot tell you why.
The "Book" says it must be done, and that is all
about it. They have heard and read something of
Mahomed's son, or was it Mahomed himself, being
poisoned by a Jew, and perhaps that is the reason.
They will look it up and see. So, whilst the fast is
on, they turn night into day and day into night. All
those who can sleep through the day and pray and
feast at night. The fast is observed between the
hours of four a.m. and sunset. Others less fortunate,
who must work through the day, have a hard
time. Not a sup of water nor bite of bread will pass
their lips until dusk.</p>

<p>It follows that the work suffers. The chairs and
tables in my bungalow are thick with dust: the house
is untidy and uncomfortable. My servants are fasting.
At sundown they come to life, and, after prayer,
break their fast. When they have administered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
my wants they go to the town where they play, pray,
and feast all night with their friends.</p>

<p>To-night I heard the cannon fired at Jibouti by
the French authorities to warn their Mahomedan
subjects that the day had passed. I had been to
the sports ground where a few of the keener lads had
turned up to play hockey. Syyed Khudar the Arab,
and his brother-in-law, were there, also Sub-inspector
Buralli. Just before I arrived Syyed and
the brother-in-law had quarrelled. Hungry men are
angry men; blows followed words, and Buralli
arrested them.</p>

<p>Buralli explained to me that the trouble between
the two men was of long standing&mdash;"rooted deep
down in their stomachs!" Syyed is an independent
trader, his brother-in-law is a carpenter. The
latter's wife continually twits him with his poverty,
comparing her own hard lot with the easy one of her
sister. In consequence, when the carpenter sees
Syyed the whole world turns black&mdash;according to
Buralli. But then Buralli is fasting too. After a
good meal the whole world will be lighter coloured
for them all. But there was no hockey.</p>

<p>As the sun sank in the west nature bestirred
herself in a half-hearted effort to brighten up the
skies. But all the colours fell from her tired hands
into the sea, and spread across the face of the waters.
Old gold, gold, vermilion, purples, a mad riot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
tones, shades, and natural colours floated bewilderingly
on the dull surface for a few fleeting moments,
and were gone. Then the wind rose and lashed the
sea into sullen anger, the while the crescent moon&mdash;symbol
of Mahomedanism&mdash;smiled down complacently.
Oh, Moon, well may you smile; <em>you</em>
"that rule the night and see us not by day." But
the moon smiles on. Perhaps she can see a fairer
land than this. On she goes, through a sky, now
clear, and covered with a million flecks of gold dust.</p>

<p>A chant breaks out in the centre of the town.
Farther away a crowd of men are reciting a kind
of litany on two notes, "Allah" on a high note and
"Allah" on a low note; Allah-Allah; Allah-Allah;
a harsh breathing sound. Suddenly a horn sounds
from one of the dhows at anchor. Toot-toot-too-too-t-toot-too!
There is a hush, the town is listening.
Something is wrong. Lights appear at the end of
the pier, and a boat puts off. A policeman runs to
tell me that a dhow has broken loose. There is no
one aboard except one small boy, and he it is who
has sounded the alarm.</p>

<p>The chanting, praying, and singing in the town
re-commences. Again there is an interruption.
This time a woman screams. Scream follows
scream, until I send to inquire what is happening.
My orderly returns and informs me, with a grin, that
a "bint" is being soundly spanked by her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The young lady has been gallivanting without permission,
and the sound of her cries heard all over
the town will doubtless deter other young ladies from
keeping their appointments this night. How the
disappointed swains will bless her!</p>

<p>For a little while longer I sit listening to the noises
of the night. The wind falls abruptly, and the sea
calms down. Shoals of fish dash through the
shallow waters with a noise like the splashing of
cattle crossing a ford. I lie down at last on my
camp bed, placed for coolness on the veranda, and
dose off. I am awakened by the maddening throbbing
of a drum, beaten to warn the faithful to pray
and prepare the last meal of the night. I look at
the time; it is only one o'clock and people may eat
up to four. Oh, why do they beat that wretched
drum at this hour? On, on it throbs. In despair
I take my pencil, and write until the throbbing
ceases. It has ceased now.</p>

<p>To-day, the 29th June, is the last evening of
Ramathan, that is if we see the new moon. Yesterday
evening the townspeople failed to catch a glimpse
of her, and even though one man came from El Kori
to say he had seen her in the western sky for a few
seconds, and though the big gun at Djibouti fired
ever so many shots at sundown, our Kathi must
needs have four witnesses sworn on the Koran ere he
could grant permission to the people to break their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fast. As for the big gun, have we not heard, but
a few days ago, that the peace treaty has been signed,
and might not the firing we hear from the French
side be on that score. So all this day the Zeilawis
have fasted, and at intervals the French gun has
boomed out. I am certain we are a day behind, but
the Kathi was quite right to run no risks.</p>

<p>Just now Buralli, and Mahomed the interpreter,
came to ask for permission to bury an Arab close to
the Sheikh's tomb. He was a very influential man
who has died, according to the sub-assistant-surgeon's
diagnosis, of carbuncle on the neck. Of all days in
the year this is the best one to die, for on it the
gates of Paradise are unlocked&mdash;no one is denied&mdash;and
the Arab is considered to be a very fortunate
man. Not that he had ever done anything to make
his reception at heaven's gate in any way doubtful,
but the accident of the day makes things certain.
My servant, who is something of a radical, was much
impressed with the fact, after I had granted permission
for the body to be interred near the tomb
(which, being near to the town, is closed to the
public as a burying ground) that a distinction could
still be made between a rich man and a poor man,
even after death.</p>

<p>Well, to-day ends the Mahomedan old year, and
it is, practically, in this part of the world, New
Year's Eve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been astonished to-day to discover how
popular I have become, and I have met with nothing
but thoughtfulness and consideration for my convenience
and comfort shown by people, some of
whom I hardly knew by name. This morning the
jail-master came, personally, to see with his own
eyes that the one and only cocoanut tree in front of
my bungalow was properly watered by the prisoners.
Again this evening he came, and, although fresh
water is as precious here as beer in England, this
jolly good-hearted fellow had that tree watered again.
I was touched, but not to the extent of more than
half a rupee.</p>

<p>It is New Year's Eve, you know, and one can show
one's appreciation of thoughtfulness and kindness in
others in the shape of a small gift&mdash;silver rupees
preferred&mdash;without hurting the recipient's feelings.
All the sahibs make small gifts at this time. My
servant taught me that. He said that, although
he had never yet asked his master for a present on
the Yom-el-'Id, and never would, he had never yet
failed to receive one on that day. Being in a strong
position to do so I felt tempted to break his record,
but no ordinary mortal likes to be an exception to
the rule, and I have fallen into line. The people
expect it.</p>

<p>Haji Abdi Kheiri, a Somal trader, and by way of
being one of our Napoleons of finance, called on me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
this evening to donate twenty rupees to the poor
fund, a good way of ending the old year. He has
made some profitable deals in cattle at Djibouti, and
assures me that God expects it of him to come down
handsomely for the wretched poor. He has already
one wife, and is reputed to be looking round for
another, with the result that there is much excitement
amongst the ladies of the town. He is a stout
man, and, compared with the slim handsome bedouin
Somal, is rather coarse looking, but the majority
of the townswomen would overlook that, and would
jump at the opportunity of getting their pretty fingers
inside his money boxes. Good luck to him I say.
May Allah prosper him further; it will help the poor
fund.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the peace of this day has been
upset by people whose nerves have gone a little
wrong on account of the long fast and the broken
nights. The Midgan, sandal-maker, passed from
the hut of one of his wives, where he had been
visiting, to that of another, who said to him, "You
never take off your shoes when you come to <em>this</em>
house," meaning by that he was paying too much
attention to the other wife. As the shoemaker made
no reply the woman took off her sandal and beat him
with it, screaming the while for the police. When
the police came she said: "You must lock us both up
as we have been fighting." The police did, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
at this moment the Midgan is spending some time
in the same compartment as his neglected wife&mdash;and
has his shoes off. Then Fatuma binti Ahamed,
aged fourteen, was sent by her mother to buy milk
in the bazaar from a woman who measured it out
in a dirty cup. Fatuma, being a clean little person,
objected, and, as the woman refused to clean the
cup, she called her some names, which, by the way,
are quite unprintable. But the milk woman had a
lusty daughter, and between the pair of them they
dealt severely with Fatuma. An Arab says he
found them playing at tug-o'-war with her; one
pulling at her neck and the other at her legs, also
it was a very frightened little girl who ran home
half naked to report why the milk was delayed. Her
father has been making a great fuss, and the law,
as represented by the D.C. right down to the office
boy, and even the jail-master, has been called upon
by him to vindicate itself. He was so unreasonable
that I was strongly tempted to put him in with the
Midgan and his wife until he cooled down. But
then, some European daddies are just as silly when
their little girls get into trouble through their own
foolishness, and I have overlooked his nonsense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The people have now seen the moon. It is
nearly seven o'clock, and, though the sky is grey,
the waters of the full tide are tinted with gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
colours, a phenomenon I have not yet seen in any
part of Africa but here. Policemen, sailors, rich
men, poor men, beggarmen, thieves, are all at this
moment out in the open praying aloud to Allah.
Strangely enough at this hour, and for the first time
since I have been in Zeila, I hear the voices of
children at play, above the prayers of the adults.
The Jibouti gun is booming away, and, as if to mock
it, someone is firing an old blunderbuss outside the
town. There is, as usual, not a woman in sight,
but I can hear a few girls' voices thrilling out the
wild African call, "Lu-lu-lu-lu-luuh!"</p>

<p>The praying is over, and now to food. We have
killed the fat sheep and prepared the tastiest of
dishes. Neither little child, old woman, nor any
single soul need go hungry to bed in this town
to-night. The people are rejoicing, and all must
share in their joy.</p>

<h3>A NAUGHTY STORY</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">A remedy for loneliness&mdash;Mohamed's Story&mdash;Buralli's "unfinished"
story.</p></blockquote>


<p>The first day of the Mahomedan New Year is
nearing its close without anything unusual having
occurred, for which let us touch wood and be duly
thankful. At four o'clock this morning the people
were astir, and afterwards, from my veranda, I
watched the town beauties bathing in the sea.
Perhaps I ought not to have looked, but I <em>did</em> notice
that some of them had extraordinary fine figures, of
which they were not ashamed. By half-past five all
the bathers had gone to don their "glad rags," and
the men and boys marched onto the sports ground
behind my house, where a service was held in the
open. Afterwards, the day long, there was dancing,
singing, and feasting, in all of which the women were
very much in evidence. At sunset another burst of
prayer, more feasting, followed by general dancing
and rejoicing, marred by only one fight. Fatuma
Fareh, a divorced lady, invited to dance in a friend's
compound, had patiently watched all the other
women guests dance in their turn. When hers came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the dance broke up, and poor Fatuma, who loves
dancing, was given no opportunity of showing what
she could do on her feet. What she had to say
about it must have been to the point for one of the
women came back and smacked her face. Then the
fight started.</p>

<p>I thought it better to keep away from the town,
and Buralli and Mahomed, pitying my loneliness,
came after dinner and sat with me in front of the
bungalow.</p>

<p>"Please tell me one of your stories, Mahomed,"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," said Mahomed, "a man
came to a Somal encampment, and at the entrance
met a woman to whom he said: 'I do not talk with
women, and am in a conversational mood. Is there
ever a man here with whom I can have a chat?'</p>

<p>"'In this encampment,' said the woman, 'is only
one man, and he lies asleep inside the tent.'</p>

<p>"'Well, wake him up,' said the man.</p>

<p>"'I am ashamed to wake him,' said the woman.</p>

<p>"'For what reason?' says he.</p>

<p>"'Because his mother is my mother's child and
I am his father's wife,' she replied.</p>

<p>"That is my story," said Mahomed, "and sometimes
a Somal will sit for two days trying to find
out what relation that woman was to the sleeping
man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you a real story, Sahib," said the disgusted
Buralli, "but it is naughty. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>Now what does it matter what I answered for
Buralli told the story.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," said he (it wouldn't be a real
story if it did not start like that), "there was a very
rich Somal who had a lovely daughter, and he swore
on the Koran a hundred 'By Gods' that he would
kill the first man who asked for her hand in marriage.
He was a powerful Sheiba,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> very handy with his
spear or dagger, so, though many a youth loved the
girl, not one dared approach her father with an offer
of marriage. Now, the old man had large flocks
and employed many herds to shepherd them, but it
was his custom every morning to drive the animals
himself forth from the kraal, allowing the herds, who
had to be out all day in the sun, to sit until eight
o'clock preparing their food and water for the day.
On such occasions he went quite unarmed, and left
his spear, shield, and dagger in his gurgi;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> when
his herds relieved him he walked back alone to his
camp.</p>

<p>"A certain young man noticed the old man's habit
and thought to himself, if I go armed in the morning
to intercept and ask him for his daughter he cannot
kill me because he carries no arms, therefore I will
do this thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"So one morning the father found a young man
awaiting him on the road.</p>

<p>"'What do you want?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'The hand of your daughter in marriage,' was
the bold reply.</p>

<p>"'Have you not heard,' said the old man, 'what
I have sworn to do with anyone making that request?
Get out of my way!'</p>

<p>"'Not a bit of it, Old Man. I refuse to leave the
path or to allow you to pass until you consent to my
marriage with your daughter.'</p>

<p>"The old man raved and stormed, but, seeing he
was cornered, said, 'Very well, let us go to the
kurria together.'</p>

<p>"Now what did he want, this wise old man, but to
lay hands on his dagger? Being deeply religious,
and having passed his oath before all the big men
of his section, he felt it would be impossible to break
it by allowing this young man to live. But, as he
walked along, the thought came to him: 'Why does
this fellow, knowing me to be a man of my word, risk
his life by asking for my daughter, when every other
young man has held back? There can be no doubt
that he has a stout heart, and would make a good
husband for my girl.' So he stopped and asked the
youth for an explanation.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said the young man, 'be it not hidden
from you that I am renowned amongst my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
people, who live far from here, for three things.
Firstly, I am shameless; no matter what I do I shall
never be ashamed of it. Secondly, I am fearless;
the man who can frighten me is not yet born.
Thirdly, if a man ask me for anything I can give,
even for my life, I cannot refuse him, and I always
give with both hands and a glad heart.'</p>

<p>"So the old man was interested, and said to himself,
'I wonder if this fellow is speaking the truth.
I shall try to find out, and, if he is not telling lies,
I shall break my oath and spare his life.'</p>

<p>"And thus it came to pass that the couple returned
to the gurgi together, and after the arrangements
were completed the young man married the girl and
prepared to settle down with her people.</p>

<p>"But his father-in-law said to him, 'You must
take your wife and return to your own tribe!'</p>

<p>"'Very good, I am ready,' said he.</p>

<p>"The old man had three camels laden with mats
and rich presents, and giving his son-in-law three
days' food he said to him, 'I know you are poor,
take these camels and set forth on your journey, but
bear in mind this is all the property, you see packed
on these camels' backs, that you can expect to
receive from me.'</p>

<p>"When the man and his wife had gone his father-in-law
sent for fifty of his boldest warriors and said
to them, 'My son-in-law and his wife have taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
road towards his own people. You must wait until
he has been gone three days, and on the morning of
the fourth day, when the food I have given him will
be finished, you are to make an attack on his camp.
Should he run away you are to kill him and tell my
daughter to come home, but should he fight he must
on no account be hurt, and you are then to bring
him back to me, watching carefully on the road
how he acts.'</p>

<p>"The warriors departed, and on the morning of
the fourth day, when the young man was sitting under
a tree feeling very weak and hungry, he saw them
approaching in fighting array. He promptly saddled
up his horse, and taking his shield and spear from
his wife's hand, galloped amongst them and made a
splendid fight.</p>

<p>"Seeing this the warriors held up their hands and
called out: 'Hoi, hoi! Aman! Peace! We are your
father-in-law's people and bear a message from him.'</p>

<p>"He listened to them, and agreed to return to his
wife's people.</p>

<p>"That night there was no food, and the young
man gave orders that one of his three camels should
be killed.</p>

<p>"'You are foolish,' said his wife, 'for if you do
this thing we must throw away the load the beast
carries; don't forget we are very poor and may not
expect any further presents from my father.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I cannot see fifty men go hungry to save the
load,' said her husband. 'I shall have the camel
killed.'</p>

<p>"On the following night another camel was killed
and its load thrown away, and again on the third
night the last camel was killed, and the last of
the old man's rich presents was thrown away into the
bush.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the fourth day the party
came to the old man's camp, to whom a true
account of all that had happened was given by
the warriors. He was delighted, and made much of
his son-in-law, feasting him and paying him great
honour.</p>

<p>"One day, after the evening prayer, the old man
said: 'My son, it is time you explained to me why
you are shameless, fearless, and generous beyond
all men.'</p>

<p>"'That is easily done,' said the youth. 'Once I
went with my section into battle; we were heavily
outnumbered, and I was in the front rank. I noticed
that of the men who were afraid and stayed a little
behind many were killed by the spears that went
over the heads of us who were doing the fighting.
Thus I learned the lesson that man's life is not in his
own keeping but in God's hands. When our time
comes to die we cannot escape by running away or
refusing to fight. So I know that God will call me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at His own good time, and I leave it to Him, never
worrying about my life. For this reason I am
fearless.'</p>

<p>"'As for being generous, I am not really so as
everything I give away I believe belongs to God,
even as I told you my life is His. Once when my
brothers and I were rich two poor men came to our
camp and asked for food. We refused, and drove
them forth into the bush. Near us lived a poor man
and his wife, and to this couple the poor men went
for shelter and a bite of food. They had but a few
goats, of which they killed one, and gave the
strangers to eat and made them welcome. We
laughed and said it was meet the poor should help
the poor. Soon after that the cattle plague came
and swept off all our stock; we were left beggars,
without a bite to eat. The stock of the poor man
who had killed his goat for the poor men, sent to his
gate by God, escaped the plague and multiplied so
that he became rich. Thus I learned that we but
hold the world's riches on trust, and God to Whom
they belong can take them away from us in a single
night. The good things that come my way I share
with my less fortunate brethren whilst I have the
opportunity, lest it should pass from my hands for
ever.'</p>

<p>"And that is the end of the story," said Buralli.</p>

<p>"But you said it was a naughty story, Buralli, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
you have not explained why the young man was
shameless."</p>

<p>Buralli's eye twinkled.</p>

<p>"That is the naughty part, Sahib."</p>

<p>Like Mark Twain's "indelicate story," but for a
different reason, as Buralli did tell me why the
young man was shameless, this story must remain
incomplete.</p>

<h3>THE YIBIR</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">His characteristics&mdash;Gulaid Abokr and his Yibir&mdash;The first Yibir
and his talents&mdash;A "makran."</p></blockquote>


<p>Before the war I lived in Southern Somaliland,
where the "Sab," or outcast tribes of Northern
Somaliland, are seldom met with, and it so happened
that the first representative of the hunter people&mdash;the
Midgans&mdash;whom I came across was the old pot-woman
of Zeila. And as for my first Yibir, it was
here I met and nearly passed him by. It is customary
for the Midgan, who live by hunting, to attach
themselves to a Somal family for protection, for
which they pay by acting as hewers of wood and
drawers of water. The Yibirs are much more
sophisticated, and prefer, if possible, to live by their
wits instead of soiling their hands by honest toil.
Somals will not mix, or inter-marry, with either
tribe, and look upon them as of inferior caste to
themselves.</p>

<p>This is how I nearly missed my Yibir.</p>

<p>My cook and I had been going through the weekly
accounts. He accused me of eating twelve eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and three pounds of meat every single day of my
life, and I accused him of carelessness in his method
of handling the truth, and of extravagance in
managing my commissariat. One ever gets but
little change out of a cook, and when mine proved he
was an honest man, and that I was a glutton, to his
own satisfaction and my stupefaction, it was a bad
moment for Gulaid Abokr to choose to come to me
to borrow money. He came and stood below my
veranda, coughing to attract my attention. He did&mdash;but
he would <em>not</em> go away.</p>

<p>"Sahib, I am in trouble, I <em>must</em> see you."</p>

<p>"Gulaid Abokr," I replied, "the trouble you are
in now is nothing to that you'll find yourself in
presently if you don't go right now and take that
villainous-looking companion of yours with you right
out of my compound."</p>

<p>"I can't take him away, Sahib, he is a Yibir and
is the cause of my trouble. I <em>must</em> see you."</p>

<p>I was so foolishly angry that I nearly fell over the
veranda. I had barely recovered myself when I
heard Gulaid say, "Sahib, I've just had a baby."
It was really so funny that I had to forget the cook
and my bad temper in a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Come up here, you freak," I said, "and tell me
all about it."</p>

<p>He came.</p>

<p>"Sahib," he said, "I've just had a baby boy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the Yibir has come. I have not a rupee in the house:
will you lend me four, please?"</p>

<p>Now, thanks to the cook episode I was in a
suspicious mood and not inclined to part with four
silver rupees without proper investigation, so I
called Mahomed the interpreter at once, together
with Buralli, who came with several other uninvited
guests, to assist in providing me with the following
true <em>facts</em>. Even Buralli is prepared to take a
divorce oath that they are true.</p>

<p>The first Yibir that ever was, was a sorcerer, and
used to say there was nothing God would not do for
him, nor enable him to do. He lived ever so long
ago, in the time of Sheikh Ishaak, a noble Arab who
fled to Somaliland from Mecca six hundred years
ago, and who is the founder of one of the most
powerful Somal divisions. The Yibir did so many
wonderful things that the Sheikh sent for him to
come to a small hill between Berbera and Hargeisa,
but nearer to Hargeisa than Berbera, and there the
two men met.</p>

<p>Said Sheikh Ishaak to the Yibir, "Is this true,
all I hear concerning you, that there is nothing you
cannot do?"</p>

<p>"It is true," said the Yibir.</p>

<p>"Now I am not disputing with you," said the
Sheikh, "but I'd like to see a demonstration. Can
you go through that hill?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can," said the Yibir, and he went into the hill
and came out on the other side.</p>

<p>The Sheikh was astounded, and said, "Let me
see you do it again," and the obliging Yibir did it
again.</p>

<p>The Sheikh thought and thought, and scratched
his head, but could think of nothing better to say
than, "Let me see you do it once more," and of
course the Yibir, who was highly flattered by the
impression he had made on such a great man as the
Sheikh, went into the hill again, but, before he could
get through, the Sheikh held up his hands to heaven
and said quickly, "Oh God, don't let him come out."</p>

<p>And the Yibir never came out.</p>

<p>Now the Yibir had a son who came to the Sheikh
and said, "What's this I hear about you and my
father? Is it true?"</p>

<p>"It is quite true, my boy," said the Sheikh.</p>

<p>"Well now you have killed him, what about the
compensation, dia, that is coming to me for his
death?"</p>

<p>The Sheikh agreed the boy ought to receive some
compensation, and further that as he had killed the
sorcerer in the interests of the community the community
ought to pay. So he decreed, this holy man,
that whenever a Somal married he was to pay a
skin to a Yibir as part of the dia due to that people
for the killing of their ancestor. Further, whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a male child was born its father was to pay
another skin. Now in those days there was no
money, that was why the Sheikh said the Yibirs
were to be paid in skins, but nowadays it is more
convenient to give them money. "<em>Four</em> rupees&mdash;<em>six</em>
rupees, something like that."</p>

<p>So, when a baby boy is born a Yibir comes along
with a long stick, which he balances on the back of
his hand. Then the stick runs along his arm and
balances on his shoulder. When the father of the
baby sees this, he knows the man before him is a
Yibir, without doubt, and he pays him, "four rupees&mdash;six
rupees, something like that." After some incantations
the Yibir goes to the bush and cuts some
tiny sticks, which he sews up in a bit of skin. He
is very particular as to the number of these sticks,
they must be more than two and less than four, and
when they are made up in the skin he hands them
to the child's parents, who tie the package on
baby's arm. It is called a "makran," and if any
other Yibir come along the mother shows it to them
and they know they will not get anything more for
<em>that</em> baby. But if a new baby boy comes, and the
parents cheat the Yibir out of his dues, something
dreadful is bound to happen.</p>

<p>Now as Gulaid Abokr's wife has just presented
him with a bouncing boy, and as Gulaid and all his
friends have spent more this New Year than they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
can afford, and are out of cash, and as, after a
careful search, I find the cook has left me with four
rupees in hand, it would be a pity if anything were
to happen to the baby, so I lend the money.</p>

<p>Mahomed then confides a tremendous secret to
me.</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir, what I am going to tell you now
is a fact, and I am prepared to pass my oath on the
Koran that it is true. This same Yibir came to my
house last night and said, 'Let me tell you your
luck!' I said, 'Good!' He told me to take a
new loin cloth and four rupees from my box and
accompany him to another house. I went with him,
taking the articles, for I feared a trick. When we
entered a house he said, 'Spread the cloth on the
ground.' I spread it on the ground, and he said,
'Now put the four rupees on it.' I put them on.</p>

<p>"He then took a thread from the cloth I was
wearing and rolled it into a ball, which he kept in the
palm of his hand. He said, 'If your luck is good this
thread will turn into a lock of human hair. If it is
bad it will turn into a human eye.' I watched him
very closely, for I still feared a trick. He closed
his hand, opened it quickly, and, 'Wallahi,' the
thread had turned into human hair. Then he
picked up the new cloth and the four rupees
saying, 'As your luck is good this is my commission.'
Now what do you think of that, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think, Mahomed," said I, "that there are as
indifferent rascals, and just as big fools, in Somaliland
as any other part of the world."</p>

<p>This morning I passed Gulaid Abokr's slim
young wife, and noticed the baby she carried on
her back was wearing a neat new "makran" on his
arm. Said I to myself, "I wonder who pays the
Yibir his fee for that makran&mdash;baby's father or I?
I have my doubts." But baby's mother looked so
happy, and smiled so sweetly, that I'll forgive
Gulaid Abokr if he never pays me back.</p>

<h3>THE ISLAND</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The trip to the island&mdash;Fishing&mdash;Frenchmen, Greeks and Chinamen&mdash;Sharks
and bêche-de-mer&mdash;El Kori.</p></blockquote>


<p>"Is the boat ready, Buralli?" I ask the Somal
sub-inspector of police.</p>

<p>"Ha! Sahib, it is ready."</p>

<p>"Who are coming with me?"</p>

<p>"A sergeant of the water police, two boatmen,
your orderly, your cook, your servant, and the
Arab Syyed. I am sending the riding camels to
El Kori to-night and they will await you there in
the morning. You can cross from the island,
where the Chinamen are, to the mainland near
El Kori in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Buralli. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Salaam, Sahib!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later we are all aboard, bound for
the island near the French Somaliland border,
where a party of Chinamen are collecting bêche-de-mer
and shark's fins. With her nose pointing
North of West, her dhow-rigged sail bellying to the
fresh north-east breeze, the little government boat
is soon making her seven knots. Syyed, the Arab,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
has brought lines and hooks and is busy adjusting
the bait. A small fish, a little bigger than a sardine,
is attached to the hook at a special angle, so that
it will spin as it glides over the water. Syyed,
who works with the assurance of a past master of
his art, binds the bait with a piece of palm-grass
as a finishing touch. There is a twist of his arm
and the line is trailing far out to the stern, where
it ends in a little silver streak on the surface of the
blue water. The boat is small, the breeze is fresh,
and the cook is feeling both afraid and unwell. He
droops like a tired plant and all expression fades
from his face until, with a sharp jerk of his line,
Syyed begins to haul in. In a second he gives a
cry of pain and almost drops the line: it has cut
his finger to the bone. I grab in time to save the
situation, and there is an exciting tussle. The line
swings out left and back again right like a huge
pendulum. I can feel it biting into the flesh of my
hand, but haul away, and, with a swing, land a
huge barracouta in the bottom of the boat. Then
it is I learn that the cook, alarmed by Syyed's
cry, and thinking the boat was going over, had
attempted to jump overboard. A heavy blow on
the head from the water police sergeant's fist had
caused him to change his mind. My remarks on
his foolishness soothed him back to his former state
of lethargic misery. The bait is bent again, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
line spins out, but nothing happens for some time.
Syyed tells me of a fine box he hopes to sell me
when we return to Zeila, and I am very interested,
when whir-r-r-r goes the line. Syyed is not
napping this time; he has the affair well in hand,
but the line is all out, and he is making no headway.</p>

<p>"It cannot hold on much longer, Syyed, or
something is going to break," I say, as I take a
hand.</p>

<p>There is a sharp tussle and the line comes away.
I watch Syyed hauling it in.</p>

<p>As soon as we can see we both ejaculate, "hook
gone!"</p>

<p>"That was a whopper, Syyed."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a ray; they run to over three hundred
pounds sometimes on this coast. The best way to
get them is with a harpoon. One day I will take
you off Sa'ad-d-din and show you sport."</p>

<p>We are running near an island now and the
water is shallow, so the line is stowed away.
Bump, bump, bump, we are aground. The men
spring overboard and push her over a hundred
yards of shallows and spring in as we reach the
deep water. Syyed is making ready more bait
when crash goes the bamboo yard and the sail
collapses. It is lowered and freed as quickly as
possible. Meanwhile I keep a stern eye on the
cook, who informs me nothing in the world will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
induce him to return in this boat on the morrow.
A splint of sticks, evidently kept for such an
emergency, makes a temporary repair of the broken
bamboo, and a smaller sail is bent instead of the
large one we have been using. No more fishing
now; we anxiously watch the bamboo as the
breeze stiffens, and we fairly fly through the water.
At four-fifteen p.m. we are close to the Chinamen's
island, just two and a quarter hours since leaving
Zeila. It is a low sandy island, so narrow that I could
almost throw a stone across it. From it, when the
tide is out, it is possible to walk along a narrow
winding riband of sand to the mainland.</p>

<p>As we come alongside the beach a dhow passes
us a few yards away. It is from Jibouti, and a
white man in the stern stands up to doff his cap.
Syyed informs me he is a Greek fishing for a
Frenchman who is camped on the island. Sure
enough there is his camp, and a tall figure rises
from a chair to give me a salute. Two Chinamen
are waiting on the beach and ask me to drink tea,
but, much as I dislike hurting their feelings, I
cannot face the interior of their hovel, a construction
of grass mats and driftwood. My own table
is set up outside, and I drink their excellent tea and
enjoy some very good cake. After that I talk for
some little time before walking to the Frenchman's
camp to pay my respects and satisfy my curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
They have a nice clean little encampment, in which
I enjoy the drink so hospitably offered. The
Frenchman informs me that he employs natives to
net fish, and pays them by the pound for what they
bring to him. He provides the nets, of which he
shows me a wonderful collection, ranging from
drag nets imported from Marseilles to the African
circular throwing net. A sporting little affair this
latter. They cut up the fish&mdash;nearly all sharks&mdash;into
strips, which they cover with salt for twenty-four
hours, then wash in the sea and hang in the
sun to dry. The shark skins, fins, and tails are
saved. The venture is as yet unproved, and the
Frenchman informed me he hoped to find a market
for the bulk of his dried shark's flesh at Zanzibar.
I am doubtful if he will. Their catch to-day, they
tell me, consisted of one hundred and thirty sharks.
My face must have betrayed my inward doubt of
this statement for I was conducted to a heap of
tails and fins fresh enough to convince me of its
truth.</p>

<p>It is getting dark and we sit down and chat.</p>

<p>"It is peaceful, Monsieur," said the tall Frenchman.
"It is difficult to believe there is so much
unrest in the world when one sits here at eventide."</p>

<p>I look round. Two natives are wading through
the shallow water towards our island, and as they
come they stop occasionally to throw the circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
nets they carry. They are making a good haul.
Syyed is talking to the Chinamen, a hundred yards
away; my servant and orderly are erecting my
camp bed. A few fishermen are kneeling round
camp fires cooking their evening meal. I can see
all over the tiny island. Along the coast a red
light, and then a white, becomes visible as the
darkness closes quickly round us.</p>

<p>That is Jibouti. Perhaps there is a liner lying
in the harbour, homeward bound, full of passengers
going to Europe. There will be ladies and little
children, and now it is nearly dinner-time. How
far away and unreal it all seems. There is scarcely
a sound. My companion is very silent. I am
aroused from my reverie by the splash, splash,
splosh, splosh in the water of small fish trying to
escape from some monster who seeks his evening
meal.</p>

<p>"You have not answered my question, Monsieur,"
says the tall Frenchman. "It is peaceful
here?"</p>

<p>"Pardon," I reply, "I did not realise it was a
question, but even here there is war."</p>

<p>"How? Where?"</p>

<p>"In the waters!"</p>

<p>"True, and never ending war!"</p>

<p>"Were you fighting in France, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, doubtless you find it peaceful here."</p>

<p>Again a very long silence, then, "Monsieur, my
companion has just returned from Jibouti. Have
you heard any news?"</p>

<p>"No! my European news is seventeen days old.
What is it?"</p>

<p>Later I sit down to dinner, and, as I must be
up betimes, I call the Chinamen to ask some
questions concerning their work.</p>

<p>"You are collecting bêche-de-mer and shark
fins?"</p>

<p>"We were, but our master has gone to China,
and there are only two of us left; until he returns
we have ceased work."</p>

<p>"So I cannot see you at work in the morning."</p>

<p>"No! we are not working now."</p>

<p>I am bitterly disappointed as I have come purposely
to see them catching and preparing the
bêche-de-mer for market, but I turn in determined to
find out all I possibly can, under the circumstances,
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Next morning I woke up to find Syyed and an
Arab standing near my bed with lines out. With
prawns for bait they were having splendid sport.
The waters were swarming with fish.</p>

<p>Dressing hurriedly I saw the first of the Frenchman's
boats coming in with a load of fish, and I
ran along to meet it. Over seventy sharks was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
haul, but the biggest one was not more than three
feet long. There were very few other fish, and
they were mostly gurram. There was some talk
between my men and the fishermen.</p>

<p>"This," said the water police sergeant, picking
up a shark eighteen inches long, "is a Sheiba (old
man), he will not grow another inch!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, he is dead," I remark.</p>

<p>"I mean he is full grown," replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>The fishermen said that was a fact.</p>

<p>"This," said someone else, picking up a shark
with a head like a plane, on the sides of which
projected his eyes, "is a youngster, and of all the
sharks he is the worst kind."</p>

<p>In the centre of his flat head (and underneath) was
his mouth, and it was easy to understand that he
must, as the men explained, turn on his back to
seize his prey.</p>

<p>For a solid half-hour I listened to yarns that would
have given any writer of sporting fiction valuable
material to work on, yet I believe they were in the
main true. There was one of a pearl diver, attacked
by one of these flat-headed monsters, which seized
him by the face. How he struck out wildly with a
pearl oyster he was holding in his hand, and by sheer
good luck hit the fish on the eye, causing it to let
go. Like a flash he struck out for the surface and
was pulled out, just in time, by his mates in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
boat. Not one gruesome detail was omitted, from
the first attack to the ending, when the doctor sewed
up the wounds. I heard of fights with sword fish
caught up in nets. How the men's faces showed
their hatred of these brutes that throw their cruel
swords about in their struggles to get free, and woe
betide the obstacle of flesh and blood that stops a
blow. When they find a sword fish in the net the
fishermen drop a noose over his sword and, hauling
him close against the boat, beat him with poles
until there is no fight left in him, when they haul him
aboard and cut off his head.</p>

<p>But breakfast is ready and the sun comes up like
a great ball of molten metal to remind me that the
day will be too hot to allow of any waste of the
precious morning hours.</p>

<p>Breakfast over a Chinaman produces a specimen
of the sea slug (bêche-de-mer) in which I am so
interested. It might quite easily be a banana
turning black from over ripeness, judged from
appearances at least. The skin appears to be
rough, but is not exceptionally so to the touch.
The Chinaman conducts me to a furnace of plastered
mud in which is set a flat-bottomed pan which
might once have been a low bath of the kind used
in bedrooms. In this pan, he explains, the fresh
slugs are roasted before being buried in the sand
for twenty-four hours. They are then washed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
sea, roasted again, and finally hung out in the sun to
dry. When quite dry they are shipped by dhow to
Aden; thence to China by steamship. Fortunately,
he had a few specimens of the dried slugs, and again
they might quite easily have been mistaken for dried
bananas.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 372px;"><a name="SYYED" id="SYYED"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_133fp.jpg" width="372" height="600" alt="SYYED" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SYYED KHUDAR THROWING THE CIRCULAR NET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Chinaman could speak no English, but his
Arabic, though ungrammatical, was fluent enough
to enable me to extract much interesting information.
The slugs like shallow water with a sandy bottom.
On hot, sunny days when the sea is calm they lie
on top of the sand, and, though they have no fins,
can swim quite well. If the weather is cloudy and
the sea rough they burrow into the sand and lie
low. They are most easily caught on clear
calm days with a circular throwing net, smaller than
the ordinary throwing net but of precisely similar
construction. This net is of the same shape as a
spider's web, is weighted all round the outside with
small pieces of lead. When the net, which is of
fine cotton string, is held in the centre by the hand
lifted as high as the head of a medium-sized man the
weights are well on the ground. The net is doubled
over and over on the back of the right hand until
the pieces of lead are just clear of the fingers. A
few of the lead weights are caught lightly in the
fingers of the left hand and with a circular sweep of
the right arm the net is thrown. The left hand at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the same moment being drawn gently back as its
fingers release their hold. This ensures the full
spread of the net, which opens out like the loop of
a well-thrown lasso, the lead weights lying in a
circle on the sandy bottom of the shallow water in
which alone it is used. The right hand retains hold
of a cord in the centre of the net which gradually
takes the form of a spherical cone (as the hand is
raised), the base of which is held to the bottom by
the weights. The net is then gradually raised and
these weights drag along the bottom until, at last,
they meet, and in the folds of the net above them
is the quarry that has been unwary enough to allow
the near approach of the fisherman.</p>

<p>Before leaving the island I was curious to hear
to what use the dried sharks' tails and fins are put.
A Chinaman picked at a dried fin with his knife,
exposing a number of white fibres within. These,
he said, were what were eaten, and I was shown a
biscuit tin full of the prepared article that was
exactly like transparent shredded gelatine. It is
used for thickening soups and giving a highly
appreciated flavour to meat dishes. Nothing is
wasted, I am informed, even the shark's liver being
boiled down for oil, and good skins saved for fancy
work. Yes! I heartily agree with that statement.
In neither the French nor Chinese camp is there
any sign of waste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Saying good-bye I sailed away from one of the
most sporting little communities it has ever been my
lot to visit. Syyed is of the same opinion.</p>

<p>A half-hour's sail and a two mile walk, in an
unbearably fierce sun, brought us to El Kori, a
small police post on the Anglo-French border.
What a barren spot! One small police hut and the
gurgi<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of an old man employed to pack water on his
donkey for the police here, and the men on the
island. There is a Somal burial ground, and the
graves are well cared for. Some are ringed round
with stones, on which are laid sea shells and the
mounds made of red, blue, black, and white coloured
stones. The graveyard is the cheeriest spot at
El Kori.</p>

<p>By three o'clock I had finished my business, the
camels were saddled, and we were soon wending our
way home along a good hard track. Three miles
outside Zeila we stopped at Tokusha, where are the
wells that supply the town with water. Here are
several native gardens, the best one being owned by
an ex-Pathan soldier, who, after taking his discharge
in India, returned to Zeila where lived his Somal
wife, whom he had married whilst serving in her
country. His garden of lime and orange trees,
flowering shrubs and vegetables, irrigated from the
wells, is a beautiful little spot, which the old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
loves with heart and soul. 'Tis a pity there are not
more of his kind in Somaliland.</p>

<p>Home from the wells to find the boat has returned
hours ago. Syyed is waiting with a beautiful old
Arab box, the like of which I have been hunting
after for years, and, when it changes owners at a
reasonable price, I feel that I have spent a perfect
day.</p>

<p>The waters of the Somaliland coast literally team
with fish. At one spot in particular it would be
possible to load a ship with crabs. I once saw His
Majesty's Commissioner send two servants with a
bucket each to bring crabs from this place. He
might have been ordering them to bring sand from
the seashore, so certain he seemed they would find
crabs. Within three-quarters of an hour the men
were back with both buckets brim full. For such
a splendid supply surely there must be a market
somewhere in the world. But I think I have
written enough about fish for one day.</p>

conscience&mdash;from a distance&mdash;but at close quarters
the smell&mdash;ugh! They are of all sizes, and the
ordinary Zeila pearler may ship a crew of anything
from five up to twelve men, under a nachoda or
native captain. The equipment required is simple.
A small canoe or boat, a paraffin-tin cut in half,
with a pane of glass soldered in the bottom, a few
pieces of bent iron wire to close the divers' nostrils
when they dive. Such comprises the outfit. A
very primitive one indeed.</p>

<p>When a dhow wishes to fit out the following is the
procedure. The captain&mdash;who, like the majority of
his class, is generally up to his neck in debt&mdash;waits
on a pearl buyer to ask for an advance. The latter
makes inquiries as to the size of the dhow, the
crew, and other particulars. These completed to
his satisfaction he issues supplies of rice, dates,
and other food, with perhaps a dash in the way of
solid cash, and in return the nachoda agrees that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
buyer will participate in the profits of the dhow over
a given period. The arrangement is generally thus:
to the buyer, or financier, the return of all moneys
expended, and after that one third of what remains;
the remaining two thirds are divided equally between
the captain on the one hand and the crew on the
other.</p>

<p>All preliminaries arranged the dhow puts to sea.
There are no sleeping quarters provided for the
crew, who sleep as best they can. But what does
that matter in a climate where man for choice always
sleeps in the open air, with the sky for roof. Cooking
is done over a wood fire burning in an old barrel
filled with mud or sand. When the pearling ground
is reached the dhow is anchored from time to time
and the canoe lowered. Into it descend a couple of
divers armed with their nostril-closing devices, and
the paraffin-tin with the glass bottom. One of the
men presses this latter about an inch below the
surface of the water, keeping his head inside the tin.
The glass gives a clear unruffled surface through
which he can see the bottom of the sea, on which
he keeps a sharp look out for shells, or likely ledges.
Should his trained eye sight anything, a motion of
his hand to the other man, who is gently paddling,
brings the canoe to a standstill. The diver adjusts
his nose-iron, stands up and dives. Down, down,
down he goes from ten to fifteen times the depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
water that could be measured between the tips of
his fingers&mdash;from right hand to left&mdash;when the arms
are extended at right angles to the body; for it is
thus the divers measure depth.</p>

<p>With a knife he quickly severs three pearl oysters
from the rock, arranging them one under the
left arm, one in the left hand, and one in the right
palm, so that it will not interfere with the raising
stroke of his arm, as he strikes out for the surface.
Then up he comes, bringing with him what one
diver graphically described to me as, "God alone
knows." He may have found a pearl worth
thousands of rupees; he may have two good pearls;
he may have three bad ones, or, as often happens,
he may have no pearls at all.</p>

<p>When a good patch is found a line is lowered
with a basket attached. Into this the divers place
the shells they have gathered, sending up a great
many at one time to the surface. During such
operation some divers descend on the rope by means
of a stone weight. When an oyster becomes
sensible of the approach or touch of an enemy it
closes its shell, should it be open, with a powerful
snap. It often happens, therefore, that a diver's
fingers are caught, in which case they are badly
pinched, and often severely cut.</p>

<p>Of course, there are divers who own their own
boats and work independently of the buyers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
majority of these are Soudanese, who, though clever
at their profession, show anything but business-like
aptitude in disposing of their spoils. I know of
one man who dived for a pearl worth some thousands
of rupees, and which he finally disposed of to a
wily trader for ten sovereigns, a small canoe, and
a wife. When the money had all been spent on
clothes for the woman's back she left her husband,
who was not in the least perturbed. To Syyed
Khudar, the Arab, who remonstrated with him on
his folly, he replied, "Never mind, I shall go back
and dive for another pearl."</p>

<p>"Just," Syyed remarked, "as if he owned the
sea and all the pearls that are in it."</p>

<p>The divers are fearless, stout-hearted fellows, and
be there, to their certain knowledge, ever so many
sharks in the vicinity, once they have located shell
down they go. For their temerity they may have to
pay with their lives, but no such thought deters
them. "Who knows but that this dive I am going
to make will make my fortune or end my life. If
either way it has already been written in the book
of fate, so be it," is the diver's philosophy. But
more lives are lost than fortunes are found by the
men who dive. When the gods smile upon them,
and their pockets are lined with rupees, they fritter
their money away without a thought. Sanguine in
the extreme, by very virtue of their calling, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
give no thought to the future. Deep in their hearts
is an invincible belief that they are bound to strike
lucky again.</p>

<p>A pearl from our waters may change hands many
times ere at last it adorns the neck of some fair lady
in Europe, or a darker sister in Bombay. What
stories some pearls could tell if they could only
speak of the cut-throats and "<em>sharks</em>" in whose
pockets and waist bands they have travelled. Many
a story of treachery and blood letting, too, I warrant,
that would disturb the dreams not a little of their
gentle owners. Even in dealing with the stones
there is as much excitement as in diving for them.
The tale goes that once upon a time a diver entered
a cloth-dealer's shop in Aden, the proprietor of
which was absent. He approached a young Indian
assistant, and drawing a pearl from the folds of his
waist-cloth offered it for sale. The Indian was so
struck by the size and beauty of the stone that,
although he knew nothing whatever of pearls, he
agreed to purchase it for five hundred rupees. But
how to pay for it? He had not a penny in the
world. Ah, his master's safe was full of rupees.
He helped himself, paid for the stone and repaired
hurriedly to the house of a dealer whom he knew,
where he offered the stone for sale, hoping to make
at least a hundred rupees clear profit for himself,
and to replace his master's money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The buyer examined the stone and said: "I shall
give you two thousand rupees for it."</p>

<p>The Indian thought the other was having a little
joke at his expense and said, "Ah, my friend, do
not laugh at me."</p>

<p>The buyer thought he had to do with a man who
knew a little about pearls and said, "Very well,
I'll give you three thousand rupees for it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, be serious!" said the Indian,
"and do not waste my time with your jokes."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the other, "I shall give you
four thousand rupees for the stone."</p>

<p>The Indian, at last perceiving the dealer was
in earnest, and very excited, wisely stood out
for more. He sold for seven thousand rupees.
Drawing five hundred rupees on account he raced
back to the shop in time to replace the money he
had extracted from the safe before its disappearance
had been discovered. He considered he had done
a very good day's work, and set up a shop of his
own. The pearl was re-sold in Bombay for twenty-four
thousand rupees!</p>

<p>Nowadays Zeila pearls, or most of them, are
supposed to find their way into the hands of the
only buyer, an Indian, who finances the divers on
a large scale. But when the dhows are working
they remain out for days, with the result that the
shells open in the sun. The result is that many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
stone is extracted and hidden away, the buyer's
share thus being not so large. Of course, for
every stone so concealed, one third its value is
practically stolen from the buyer, but, apart from
the ethics of such action it is very bad policy on
the part of the diver. Stones so kept back are
always sold to rogues who give only about one-third
their real local value. Thus, all the thieves gain
out of it is a bad conscience and a doubtful
reputation.</p>

<p>Juma Bana, the Indian merchant I speak of, has
always a little assortment of stones, wrapped up
according to quality, in small pieces of red or white
cloth. He is by way of being the local expert, and,
by aid of his magnifying glass, will pick out the
better grade stones from the inferior, telling you
what is wrong with the latter as he does so. To
please Juma a stone must be perfectly round, of a
good colour, and without flaw. An almost microscopic
scratch or spot constitutes a flaw. And yet
it is Juma's misshapen collection of pearls that I
love best to examine, even though he assures me
that they are of no value at all. To my mind their
very irregularity accentuates the beauty of their
delicate indescribable lights. What happens to
them I know not, but one can buy dozens of the
smaller kinds for a song. Poor stones!</p>

<p>The pearl shells are worthy homes for the stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
They are very beautiful. It is as if they were lined
with dissolved pearl to provide tiny baths for the
fairies. They are, however, used for less romantic
purposes, being made into buttons and ornaments
for every day mortals. But no ornament could
possibly be more beautiful than a plain mother-o'-pearl
shell with its cool, pure lining of ice-white,
bordered with delicate and deep greens, as the
colour of the tropical sea in certain changing lights.</p>

<h3>A PEARL DIVER AT HOME</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Adan Abdallah and his story&mdash;Another story in which I play
a part.</p></blockquote>


<p>Adan Abdallah was born somewhere in the
Soudan, and belongs to the class formed from
mixed tribes belonging to that country, and known
in North and East Africa as Soudanese. This
means that he is Mahomedan, and has severed all
connection with his mother tribe, whatever it may
have been. Many years ago a rich Arab, making
the holy pilgrimage from Khartoum to Mecca, was
accompanied by Adan in the capacity of servant.
On the return journey the Arab succumbed to
smallpox at Jeddah, and Adan, being without a
penny in the world, and having had some experience
on the large sailing boats of the Nile, shipped as a
sailor on a dhow trading between the Arabian
coast and Zeila. At Zeila he left the Arab boat and
joined a pearler. In the course of time he did so
well that he was able to purchase a dhow of his own,
marry a Somal girl and make a little home for himself
and wife in the town.</p>

<p>That is many years ago, and nowadays there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
as many young Adans running about as years have
passed since he married. Once he changed his place
of residence from Zeila to Djibouti, but left the
latter place in disgust for the following reason. He
had sailed his dhow from the French port down the
British coast to Wakderia, beyond Berbera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ing and fired off their rifles as a sign they were
returning to the rescue. Hearing this the Arabs
ran for their dhow, but not before they had killed
the small boy, and a couple of their own number
were lying prostrate in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>Adan returned to Djibouti, calling in at Zeila on
his way to report the occurrence.</p>

<p>Some time after his arrival at Djibouti the same
Arab dhow put in there, and Adan, thinking Allah
had delivered the murderers into his hands, went
quickly to the French officer and laid a charge
against them. He was informed, as the occurrence
took place off the British coast, the French authorities
could do nothing. Adan felt very sore and
was under the impression that his story was not
believed.</p>

<p>"All right," said he, using the expression that
comes so handy to greater men than he when they
are up against a stone wall, "wait and see!"</p>

<p>As the Arabs hung around Djibouti for some time
Adan was convinced they were waiting for him to
put to sea, in order that they might attack him, and
so avenge themselves for the loss of a couple of their
number, whom he now learned had died from
wounds received at his hands.</p>

<p>Again he repaired to the French authorities to
report his suspicions, but they, having no corroborative
evidence, would take no action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said he again, "wait and see!"</p>

<p>Whether the Arabs were tired of waiting for
Adan, or had no actual designs upon him at all, and
had finished their business, they, at any rate, put to
sea at last. Only a few miles outside the harbour
they attacked a French dhow, killing five of the
crew of eight. Of the remaining three two were
too old to be of any use, so they were run ashore
on a small island, with their dhow, and abandoned.
The two old men got safely back to Djibouti, where
they reported what had happened. The third was
carried off to Arabia as a slave.</p>

<p>Then the French Hakim sent for Adan and
asked, "What's this story you have been telling
concerning these piratical Arabs?"</p>

<p>Said Adan, "As you would not believe me when
you had a chance to lay these fellows by the heels,
what's the use of troubling me now that they have
gone?"</p>

<p>The French Hakim smiled&mdash;Adan claims that
smile was a graceful admission of the mistake he
had made&mdash;and pointed out how hard it was for
him to act on a vague opinion formed by Adan
that some, seemingly harmless, Arabs were going
to kill him.</p>

<p>Adan replied that if men in his trade did not take
strict heed of what their wits tell them may happen,
that thing is sure to happen, as bad men do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
write letters to the people they wish to kill, but just
kill them, and when they least expect it. He concluded
this piece of wisdom by asking the French
Hakim, "What about the fight at Wakderia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what about it?" said the Hakim, "it took
place in British waters, and, in any case, we could
take no action on your evidence. Why, you admit
yourself, you killed two Arabs."</p>

<p>"If that is the case," said Adan, "I am going
back to Zeila, and if ever those Arabs come there
I'll have them punished. Should I stay here you'll
let them come and kill me before you raise a hand."</p>

<p>And at Zeila he has made his home ever since.</p>

<p>Fitting out from there he proceeded to the
Arabian coast, and, at a point between Sheikh
Sa'eed and Khor Omeira, the dhow ran short of
water. Adan, with half a dozen sailors, put off in
a boat for the mainland, and having filled the goat-skins
they had brought with them at a well, they were
about to look for firewood when a party of Arabs
armed with guns appeared, and asked who the devil
had given them permission to land there.</p>

<p>"We are getting water and collecting firewood,"
explained Adan, "and have no intention of staying
here or of doing any harm."</p>

<p>"Well, we want to collect something from you,"
said the Arab Sheikh in charge. "Thirty riales
you'll pay us, and a good supply of jowari grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
must be landed for us from yonder dhow ere you
ever set foot aboard her again."</p>

<p>"Ya, Sheikh," said poor Adan, "I have only
three riales in the world. Here they are. Tie them
up in your cloth like a good man, and in the name
of God let us go in peace. We can do without the
firewood to-day!"</p>

<p>"You pay us thirty riales, oh, sailor," said the
Sheikh, "and you land the grain, or you die,
together with these men who accompany you."</p>

<p>Well, Adan had no grain aboard his dhow, and
would have been only too glad to get out of
the position he found himself in by paying thirty
riales had he had them.</p>

<p>"I was explaining this," he told me, "to the
Sheikh, a very quick-tempered man, when without
a word of warning, <small>CHAP</small>! he fired off his gun and
hit me in the leg with the pieces of iron he'd loaded
it with. I fell to the ground and lay like a log
whilst my men took to their heels and made a run
for the boat, with the Arab party hot on their
tracks. Thinking I was dead the Sheikh paid no
further attention to me. Aboard the dhow we had
some Gras rifles, with which the sailors, who had
not come ashore, opened fire, and easily drove off
the Arabs, who were armed with old muzzle loaders.
In the excitement that ensued I crawled the short
distance to the beach, and the sailors seeing me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
sent off a boat and I got away. But when I came
back to Zeila the doctor cut off my leg, and Gyyed
the carpenter made me this wooden one, which I
can get about on quite comfortably. Thank God,
I can still dive!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," I exclaimed in
astonishment, "that you still dive?"</p>

<p>"What else do you think I could do?" replied
Adan. "It is my bread and butter."</p>

<p>I should say Adan is a very shrewd man and
knows how to look after his money, even though
he no longer possesses a dhow of his own.</p>

<p>A few days since I had an opportunity of observing
that his wife and children were as well dressed
as any in the town.</p>

<p>As next-door neighbour he has a blind Arab,
who lodged a complaint that Adan made a door
through his compound. There was a lengthy
argument in the court, which, in spite of the fact
that of the two disputants one was blind and the
other was minus a leg, led me to fear, unless the
matter was settled, it might develop into something
serious. I told both men to go away and keep quiet
until the evening, when I should come myself to
their houses and see for myself what was the matter.
On arriving there later I found that these two men
lived in houses of the same size, built side by side
and so close together that I could neither walk nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
see between them. In front, as well as behind, was
a street. From the centre of the Arab's house a
grass and wood fence ran onto the street fence,
dividing the space between the two houses and the
street into two compounds. When Adan walked
out of his door he was in a compound, one side of
which was walled in by his own house and half the
Arab's house. The width of the Arab's compound
on the other side was only equal to half that of
his own house; obviously a very unfair arrangement.
Opening out of Adan's compound onto the street
was a wooden door.</p>

<p>I was inclined to decide against Adan, but he
pointed out that on the other side of the houses the
arrangement was reversed, and that half his house-back
was in the Arab's compound. This I found
to be the case, and, pointing out to the Arab that
what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the
gander, said that he could not have matters changed
on one side of the houses to suit his convenience,
unless he conformed to similar changes on the other.</p>

<p>The old man did not like this idea, and then the
true cause of complaint was revealed. He loves
his afternoon nap, but is unfortunately a very light
sleeper. Just at the time when his head touches
the pillow it appears to be the busiest time of the
day for Adan's thirteen children, who seem to be
perpetually passing through that wooden gate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Like all gates in Zeila it is latched on the inside, and
every time a youngster comes to it from the outside
he bangs it with a stick, until someone from the
inside opens. Now, as bad luck will have it, the
gate is in front of the Arab's half of the house that
is in Adan's compound, and very near to the old
man's head. So that with the everlasting procession
of kiddies&mdash;sheitans he calls them, which means
devils&mdash;passing to and fro, plus the banging of the
gate, an afternoon siesta is out of the question. It
was all right until Adan, but two weeks before, had
bought the unlucky wooden door.</p>

<p>"But now," said the old man, pounding viciously
on the ground with his long stick, "it is all wrong."</p>

<p>Adan agreed it was trying. He had noticed the
nuisance himself, and if the old man had told
him before, he would have had it remedied. He
was quite prepared to have a muster now, and
thirteen young imps of mischief&mdash;they were all there,
every mother's son and daughter of them&mdash;were
paraded and informed that, between the hours of
two and four p.m. daily, the wooden door on side
number one was barred to all children under pain of
being flayed alive, cut to pieces, or sent to jail, or all
three. There was a grass door on side number two,
which no one could bang, and which was at their
service. By which order and threats, I am sure,
Adan made the wooden door near the old Arab's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
head, when he is lying down, the most irresistible
spot in the world to bang. There'll be more to come
of it. "Wait and see!"</p>

<p>What with Arab pirates, Arab robbers, truculent
Arab neighbours, a livelihood that requires diving
for with only one leg&mdash;not to speak of sharks, and
thirteen young sheitans requiring a strong right arm
to keep them in order&mdash;I shall surely not be accused
of exaggeration when I describe the life of Adan
Abdallah, the Soudanese, as being an eventful one.</p>

<h3>MANY TRIBES</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Hayoun the Jew "At Home"&mdash;Hayoun's largesse&mdash;Hindus,
Parsees and vaccination&mdash;Buralli's knowledge of legs.</p></blockquote>


<p>The élite of our town is composed almost entirely
of Arabs, Indians, and Jews, who mix little with
the Somals. Of course, money talks, and Haji
Abdi Kheiri, the rich Somal trader, is getting his
foot into the higher circles, but as yet he is little at
ease amid the gaiety of social gatherings. Yesterday
Hayoun the Jew invited all the notabilities, of
whom I am one&mdash;I must speak up for myself&mdash;to
a gathering at his house. There were present the
Indian customs superintendent, the Hindu assistant-surgeon,
the District Clerk, two Parsees, a Goanese
clerk, a few Arabs, Haji Abdi Kheiri, and myself.
Everyone was courteous and polite, and all were
most obsequious to me. As I climbed on to the
flat open roof to join the party Haji Abdi Kheiri
fired off his gun five times. This in my honour,
but being unused to such displays I thought I had
been drawn into an ambush placed ready to take
my life, and, for a second, I had an instinct to jump
back and down the steep steps. One acts hurriedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
on such occasions, I mean when one thinks there's
danger, but, fortunately for my reputation, I caught
a glimpse of Hayoun's face. He was cool and
unexcited; so reasoning that he would not look like
that were there any trouble, as his date of decease
in such a case would not be many seconds later than
mine, of which fact he would be well aware, I
advanced with a laugh and said, "Good afternoon."</p>

<p>The party&mdash;after my arrival&mdash;being all present,
and correct, and Haji Abdi Kheiri having put away
his gun (much to my relief) festivities commenced.
I sat at the head of a table where tea was served.
The whole town had been ransacked for table-covers,
the colours of which gave me a pain in the
head. I opened the ball by drinking a bottle of
ginger pop. My glass was at once replenished with
lemonade. Fruit&mdash;out of tins&mdash;was served, and
this partaken of Hayoun arose from his chair and
made a speech, saying how rejoiced the whole
community were the great British nation had
emerged so successfully from the fiery ordeal of
the greatest war in the history of the world, and
pointing out that at that table sat men of five
different creeds&mdash;Hindu, Parsee, Mahomedan,
Jewish, and Christian&mdash;who were entirely in agreement
with the sentiments he had expressed.</p>

<p>Then Haji Abdi went for his gun again.</p>

<p>"God knows," said I to myself, "whether, or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he is going to rectify the matter according to his
lights, and make the party all one religion&mdash;his&mdash;by
disposing of the other four. In any case it is
time I took a hand."</p>

<p>"Haji Abdi Kheiri," said I, "put that gun
down, sir, or you'll be shooting someone before we
break up."</p>

<p>"But Djibouti is firing salutes, and we must
also fire," said Hayoun the Jew. "I have
especially arranged with Haji that he should do this
in honour of the signing of peace. Will not your
honour grant permission?"</p>

<p>As we listened we heard the Djibouti gun booming
away, and what else was to be done but to
allow the salute to be fired. It could not be heard
as many hundreds of yards away as the French gun
could be heard miles. But at last I insisted on
Haji putting away his firearm for keeps, and
thanked the party for the nice things their spokesman
had said about our nation. I told them how
proud I was to find men of five creeds, as far apart
as five equal points of the circle, able to meet under
one flag, in friendship and unity, and to pay it such
a tribute.</p>

<p>After that a long silence, during which I drank
another bottle of ginger pop and ate more fruit.
Clearly I'd had as much as was good for me, so,
jumping to my feet, I prepared to say "Good-bye."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
But there were other things to be done. All the
town's children had collected under the walls of the
house, and Hayoun sent for ten rupees worth of
pice, making a grand total of six hundred and forty
coins to be distributed as largesse. Had I any
suggestions to make?</p>

<p>Yes, I had. It was a clear case for a scramble.
The coins were tossed from the roof, and you
never saw such a confusion of legs and arms as that
which followed. Little girls, little boys, all mixed
up like fruit in a salad, and, with the usual luck
that attends cats, drunken men and little children,
no one was seriously hurt.</p>

<p>Describe the men I met at that party? As well
set out to describe the ever-changing sea. Something
about their worldly affairs. Yes, I could do
that if I cared to abuse confidences; also something
about their very private affairs. Whose wife is not
above reproach; whose daughter is causing him
some anxiety; the main causes of sleepless nights.
But beneath it all&mdash;of the man's heart&mdash;I know
nothing. What his outlook on life is. What he
really thinks about is as a sealed book sewn up in
canvas, weighted with lead and thrown into the
ocean.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I know, that I understand, but
it is just at such times I am farthest from the truth.
When I realise my abysmal ignorance, and trust to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
blind instinct to guide me along a course inspired
by a superficial knowledge, I know I am working
on sound lines.</p>

<p>Haji Abdi Kheiri, the pure-blooded Somal, who
has to-day fired off his gun in my honour, and who
sat with me at table looking as harmless as a school
miss about to partake of Holy Communion for the
first time, is not the same man who came alone to
my bungalow, puffed up with pride and prosperity,
to donate twenty rupees to the poor fund, as a small
boy might who takes one sugar plum from a full
bag to present it to a street urchin, the while an
admiring mamma looks on. Neither is he the same
Haji Abdi Kheiri who yesterday, at the "Peace"
sports, behaved like a maniac because the town
team was beaten at its first pull by the police in the
tug-o'-war. I had counted the men myself ere
giving the signal, "Go," and was satisfied that it
was a fair pull. But he insisted otherwise. He is
no sportsman, and there were few of his breed at
that sports meeting who could lay claim to be so
called. The second pull I stopped. The spectators
were surreptitiously giving a hand to whichever side
they fancied, and Haji himself I caught in the act.
Finally, when I gave the pull to the police, there
was a scene I can liken to nothing else so much as
a pack of mad dogs barking and snarling at one
another, yet afraid to bite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>It is this sort of thing almost makes one lose
heart. On this occasion I said to myself, "If I
had a machine gun and turned it on to these
canaille, no matter how guilty I might appear in
the eyes of man, God, Who understands human
nature as He meant it to be, and Who knows, would
forgive and understand the act." At other times I
say to myself, "I know these people are devils, but
they are fascinating devils. I like them, and shall
make allowances for their devilries."</p>

<p>Then, there is always Mahomed Fara, and he is
not quite an uncommon type in Somaliland. To
have met and known him makes one look for the
good side in his tribal brethren.</p>

<p>But even I, who owe much to Somals and have
always championed them, admit it is exasperating
to have to watch them&mdash;hiding that better side away.
But such they are; in some cases men who will spend
their day praying, and then rise from their knees
to smash in a poor woman's skull&mdash;a woman who is
within a month of giving birth to a child, and
because she refuses to hand over the skin of water
she has carried three miles on her back that her
small children may drink. Such men are almost
past redemption.</p>

<p>My pen has run away with me. Since I sat down
to write such an incident as that of which I speak
has been reported and so creeps into the page. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for Hayoun the Jew, the Hindus, the Parsees and
myself, we have one point in common. We are
strangers in a strange land, so perforce try to understand
one another, and work together. Even then
there are barriers between us.</p>

<p>A few days ago the assistant-surgeon came to my
office and reported smallpox in the town. I have
already described Zeila so it is unnecessary to point
out how serious this outbreak might become.</p>

<p>"Of course everyone must be vaccinated," I
said. "Call the town-crier and let him tom-tom
such an order through the town!"</p>

<p>"Women as well as men?" asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Women as well as men," I replied.</p>

<p>"We'll have trouble with the Indian and Arab
purdah women," said the surgeon, who is a Brahmin.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "but surely there is some way of
overcoming that difficulty."</p>

<p>"Let the doctor go in and vaccinate them all,"
said the helpful Buralli. "If they are not afraid
to show their bare legs, there's no harm in showing
their arms, and they need not unveil their faces to
show their arms rather than their legs."</p>

<p>"And pray what do you know about their legs,
Buralli?"</p>

<p>"Just this," said he, "that you can see for
yourself, any day you like, that an Arab woman
thinks nothing of tucking up her skirt above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
knees; and as she wears no stockings you can't
help seeing her legs if you have eyes in your head.
And, given half a chance, if you are a good-looking
young fellow, she does not mind showing her face;
and what harm does it do her or anyone else? Let
the doctor go in and vaccinate them."</p>

<p>The District Clerk, a highly educated Indian
Mahomedan, then said, "I prefer to go to
prison before I allow the surgeon to vaccinate
my wife."</p>

<p>"Here is a good subject to reason with," I
reflected, and I produced every conceivable argument
I could think of to prove how stupid he was to
take up such a position. I might have been the
Pope of Rome trying to convince an Ulsterman
that "Home Rule" was the best thing that could
happen to Ireland. It was left to me to solve the
problem by suggesting an old woman should be
trained to vaccinate, and sent in to the purdah
women to operate on them. And this old lady is
now hard at work. God alone knows what diseases
she is spreading through the town with her dirty
needles, for, of one thing I am convinced, once she
is out of sight of the surgeon she will never trouble
to clean them.</p>

<p>As for the clerk's wife, quite unknown to him,
and possibly to her, I have seen her unveiled and
have not heard she has suffered in consequence. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
am not hankering to see her face again, for of
whatever charms she may be possessed this is most
certainly not one. It is the sort of face that can
only be improved upon by being covered up.
She should therefore be encouraged to keep it well
covered.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>SCANDAL</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Mrs Kar Krishna and Saleha&mdash;Mrs Ibrahim and a few reasons&mdash;Whisperings
and consequences&mdash;Saleha's statement.</p></blockquote>


<p>Mrs Kar Krishna is the wife of a Hindu gentleman,
and Mrs Krishna, who is a very nice woman,
may be seen by common or garden Christians.
She is very ill, and at times is in such pain that
her screams may be heard all over the town.
Saleha, an Arab purdah woman, the wife of a
shop-keeper, lives near to Mrs Krishna, and, in
the absence of her husband, has been known to
run from her house, climb the stairs to Mrs
Krishna's room and rub the poor woman's legs.
That's what I have been told. As I happen to
know the seat of Mrs Krishna's pain is situated
higher up I can't conceive why Saleha should rub
her legs instead of higher up. I'm not trying to
be vulgar. I've heard exactly what is the matter
with Mrs Krishna from Mr Kar Krishna. It's
what you used to get when you were younger and
ate of the apples that were green. It's a mysterious
thing that she should suffer from a long protracted
bout of "what you used to get," for there are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
apples to be had here for love or money; and it is
still stranger that, though Saleha's massaging did
apparently do some good, the only reliable remedy
is an injection of morphine. At least so Mrs
Krishna says, and if she does not get it the pain
becomes unbearable, and she screams&mdash;when
Saleha will come to rub her legs.</p>

<p>But Saleha's kindness of heart has brought bitter
trouble into her own life. Of course other things&mdash;the
wife of Ibrahim, the barber, is one&mdash;have
helped matters along. Mrs Ibrahim is a Pathan
woman, a Mahomedan, whose first husband died
at Zeila years ago and left her with a small family,
now grown up. She is still handsome, and
Ibrahim, an Arabianised Indian, starting business
in the town, fell a victim to her charms, and
made her his very own. She is not afraid to show
her face, and walks round the town like a Somal
woman, or the poorer Arabs, but nevertheless has
decided views as to the correct behaviour of purdah
women, to which latter class Saleha belongs. Being
a constant visitor at the Krishnas' house Mrs
Ibrahim, an Arabianised Indian, starting business
of running round to massage Mrs Krishna's&mdash;I
shall not say it again.</p>

<p>Mr Krishna is a fine looking man, and it is
whispered that ere Mrs Ibrahim met Ibrahim she
was quite a friend of his; therefore what was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
natural than that she should resent the other woman
entering his house. She knows Mr Krishna better
than you or I do. Saleha is reported to be a very
beautiful woman&mdash;I have not seen her unveiled,
so speak from hearsay&mdash;and her husband is of a
jealous, violent disposition. Once upon a time in
Arabia, during the course of an argument with
another Arab, he lost his temper so badly that he
drew a knife, and <em>snick</em>! That was the end of the
other fellow. It is also why Saleha's husband lives
in Zeila; for the other man's relatives are waiting
for him over there in Arabia. A bad man to upset.</p>

<p>However, Mrs Ibrahim did upset him by whispering
in his ear that, during his absence in
the day-time at the shop, his wife left the house to
visit at the Krishnas'. Foolish Saleha had not
asked his permission to do so, and when, one day
on returning unexpectedly from the shop, her
husband found her away he awaited her return,
and, not liking her explanations, in a fit of mad
fury tore the clothes from her back and drove her
from the house. Saleha told me so herself. She
said he had kept all her clothing, silken and other
kinds, two amber armlets, two silver anklets, the
property of her small daughter, a gold nose ring,
forty rupees in cash, ten rupees' worth of rope she
had plaited with her own hands, and her brass-bound
chest. That is how she came to see me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to ask me to get her things back, and accompanied
by her daughter, aged seven, a pretty little child,
who would have passed anywhere in Europe as a
European.</p>

<p>Saleha talked sensibly, and told me she had
been married three times. Her first husband, the
girl's father, was dead. The second divorced her,
and now the third had turned her out. Marriage
she considered a failure. I sent for the husband,
and, after seeing the pair together, realised it was
a hopeless case. The man had conformed to
Mahomedan law, since he had thrust his wife from
his house, by sending her six annas daily, as
musroof or maintenance. He did not want to take
her back. She did not want to go; but they both
professed otherwise. There was a reason.</p>

<p>Under Mahomedan law a woman, becoming
openly disobedient, and forcing her husband to
divorce her, may forfeit all right to her mehr or
dowry. Therefore, in the court, and particularly in
the Kathi's court where all matrimonial cases are
sent, she must be careful what she says, and how
she acts. Also, outside the courts she must walk
circumspectly. Foolish conduct may be misunderstood,
or seized upon as a pretext to deny her her
rights.</p>

<p>If a man is tired of a woman he may, in sundry
ways, lead her a dog's life, keeping well within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
sharia<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> himself. When she is tired of it all, and
asks for a divorce, he can keep her dangling on
until at last the woman, in desperation, will offer
to give up her mehr for her liberty. That is, very
often, the man's price; he will then divorce her
three times before witnesses. In such a case, if she
can prove his little game, she has still a remedy in
the courts. This is the weakest point in the
Mahomedan marriage laws, for the man may marry
four wives, and, whilst the poor woman is kept
hanging on as a grass widow, he may enjoy all the
comforts of married life. She may not marry again
until he has agreed to divorce her, or she has
proved such outrageous conduct on his part that
the Kathi will take the matter into his own hands.
What is called "outrageous treatment" of a woman
under European law is not always so defined under
Mahomedan jurisdiction.</p>

<p>When I sent Saleha and her husband to the
Kathi the man proved his wife was disobedient.
Had she not left her house to go visiting without
his permission? Did she not now refuse to return
to him, prepared as he was to forgive her? The
woman said she was willing to go back on the condition
that he first returned her property. The man
swore on the Koran she possessed nothing of that
which she claimed, excepting the rope, the box,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the nose ring and her clothes. That settled it.
She got these articles, but firmly refused to return
to him until all were forthcoming. They were both
playing a game.</p>

<p>We are now awaiting the return, from Perim, of
her brother with whose wife she lives, in the hope
that he will be able to patch up the trouble. Such
is the history of this year's biggest divorce case in
the high society in Zeila.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am informed that Mrs Ibrahim,
Mrs Krishna, Saleha, and all the other great ladies,
meet on fairly friendly terms; whilst Mrs Ibrahim
declares hotly that it is quite untrue she ever
dropped a hint in the ear of Saleha's husband that
if he returned unexpectedly from the shop he might
find his wife absent from the house.</p>

<h3>ON TREK</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Orders for Hargeisa&mdash;Salvage and propositions&mdash;A camel, a girl
and my policeman&mdash;Bokh and water&mdash;The sin of water
wangling&mdash;Camel-packing&mdash;The "White Running Water"&mdash;Mahomed

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Orders to proceed to Hargeisa, hurrah! The work
entailed in preparing for the journey is a pleasure to
perform. We are to cross overland by camel transport.
Boxes are overhauled, re-packed, and bound
with cord. Calculations are made as to the number
of rations required for our followers and escort, the
water to be carried and tanks for the same. All is
made ready, and all is checked; from the tin-opener
to the forage for the riding animals; from the salt to
the ammunition in the escort's belts.</p>

<p>On a Saturday afternoon the baggage camels move
out. I, accompanied by mounted police, shall follow
on riding camels two days later and catch them up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every miserable man, woman and child who has
an unsettled claim chooses this day to attend court
and ventilate it. The D.C. cannot be allowed to go
away without a reminder of the important matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
he is leaving behind. Patiently but quickly the
people are heard; then a dreadful thing happens. A
dhow, bound from Aden to Bulhar with merchandise,
was wrecked off Sad-du-din more than a week ago.
Such of her cargo as had been salved was brought
here. As I near the end of my work there walk into
the court the agents of the Bulhar merchants, armed
with powers of attorney from their principals, to
claim the salvaged goods. Some of these men have
travelled from afar. It would be wiser for me to
wait a day than to put them off. However, I know
the affair by heart. Here are all the papers and
accounts complete to date. They show, among
many other things, that the identification marks on
many of the salvaged goods have been washed off.
But if the agents agree with a scheme I have already
worked out in my mind we can finish the business in
an hour. I propound it, they listen patiently, and
make notes of what I say. As I finish they leave
the court to talk over my proposition. I await their
return&mdash;and watch the clock. A quarter to one&mdash;ten
minutes to one&mdash;one o'clock! Ah! here they
come. "We accept your scheme," they say.
"Thanks very much." That is all. I sign the
statement ready on my desk, hand it to the clerk,
and leave the office.</p>

<p>At the bungalow the chowkar has a snack of lunch
waiting. The cook and head boy have gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>At two-thirty p.m. the riding camel and one mule,
all saddled, are waiting at my door. I am ready.</p>

<p>"It is a very hot time of day, Inspector Buralli,"
I say, "to set out on a journey."</p>

<p>"It is," he replies, "but the road is long and there
is no water. The camels will stand the heat better
now, at the commencement of the journey, than
to-morrow morning should the sun catch you when
they are tired. Besides, there is a good breeze from
the right direction that will help them."</p>

<p>"Good for you. But what about this miserable
mule?"</p>

<p>"It will follow the camels. What they can do he
is up to."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="SOMAL" id="SOMAL"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_173fp.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="C" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A SOMAL HOUSEHOLD ON THE MOVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And that was saying little for the camels, for the
mule did not look "up to" much. The box of carefully
packed eggs produced at the last moment by
the chowkar is strapped behind a camel saddle. My
blanket is spread across my saddle tree, and as I take
my seat the patient camel unfolds himself, and, with
three sharp jerks, comes from the prone to the
standing position. We pass through my compound
gate, cross the square, and, with our backs to the
town of Zeila, trot off due south, along a straight
track, running through a sandy plain devoid of all
vegetation. We meet a few women heading for the
town; we pass a half-dozen more heading away from
it; farther on a spearman, followed by a small girl;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
beyond him again a girl leading a young camel
packed with a bulky, clumsy-looking load. She
pulls to the side of the road, but her brute of a camel
takes alarm at our approach, gives a circular run,
tightening the head-rope, and thus taking the girl
at a disadvantage, swings her off her feet and makes
off with the clumsiest of springs and buck jumps.
The girl clings pluckily to the rope; her light weight
and slender form cannot restrain the truculent brute.
She is thrown; she is down; she is being dragged.
Is she caught in the rope or just holding on? Holding
on, for now she has let go and is clear; during
the last ten seconds she has narrowly escaped having
her brains knocked out just as many times.</p>

<p>She is on her feet in a second, weeping and
wringing her hands&mdash;with chagrin, not pain. The
camel is unshipping his load backwards. He goes
through the clumsiest of evolutions as mats, sticks,
and the weirdest collection of parcels wrapped in
skin, slide over his tail. And although he is going
forward and all this paraphernalia is apparently
slipping backwards, it becomes entangled with his
legs and gets battered badly in consequence. Well
may the girl weep and wring her hands. She has just
covered three and a half miles of waterless plain
from the town, and here, on this open stretch of
sand, lie some two hundred pounds' weight of her
father's goods and chattels. If the camel goes&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
there he is going&mdash;she must walk back to Zeila
and leave all these things at the mercy of any
passer-by.</p>

<p>The yards and yards of rope with which Somals
pack their loads is all that is left to incommode her
wretched beast, who is fast kicking that clear of his
legs, and making for the interior, like Robinson
Crusoe's "cove," the while. It is certainly impossible
for the girl to catch him up between here and
where he is going; but Abdullah, one of my mounted
police, without waiting to make his riding camel lie
down, springs to the ground and with a wonderful
sprint, reaches and seizes the runaway, now
thoroughly maddened, by the head-rope as he is in
the act of clearing his legs from the last of the pack-rope.
Abdullah is swung from his feet and hurtled
through the air, but lands in the correct position.
He is a determined fellow; he jerks at the camel's
head; he is holding him, the brute has stopped but
struggles, cursing and swearing as only a camel can.
Abdullah, thoroughly roused, bounces round him
like a ball, and soon has him in hand. He leads
him back to the delighted girl, who takes no opportunity
of expressing her gratitude in words. She is
used to that sort of thing; we are all used to it, and
there is no comment whatever. Had the incident
happened in an English street, the following morning's
papers would have been full of Abdullah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
gallantry: his picture would have appeared in the
Sunday papers. As it is, it falls to my lot to record
his fine action, and the story may never get beyond
the pages of this manuscript.</p>

<p>But we have far to go, and the camel incident
is unfortunate. More time is lost as that contrary
brute refuses to lie down for his mistress. I am a
delighted spectator of a two-round fight between it
on the one side, and my policeman and the girl on
the other. The latter has him by the tail; everything
that is vixenish in her nature is aroused. Her
hair is disarranged, her eyes sparkle and her nostrils
dilate. As she clings to that camel's caudal appendage
she is devil enough to want to bite it. The
policemen have him by the head, and as their end
goes up the girl's end and the girl come down. As
her end goes up they and their end come down.
First round&mdash;honours even. Second round&mdash;the
camel, with a grunt of disgust, throws up the sponge,
kneels down, has a rope slipped and knotted round
his bent forelegs ere you can say "<em>knife!</em>" and the
affair is over. We leave him being loaded by the
girl, and two old women who happen to come up.
His language is shocking, and the last sight I have
of him is as he alternately has his ear "clipped" by
the girl's small hand, and his ribs kicked by her bare
foot, the while she bangs her goods, none too
gently, on his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>At six o'clock we halt at a well for ten minutes to
give our mule a drink. This is last water before
reaching our baggage camels. Riding camels may
not be ridden for some time after they have drunk
water. On from the wells until eight o'clock, when
we halt for a cup of tea and a biscuit, overhaul the
gear and give the camels an hour's rest. From nine
until midnight we trot through the moonlight, passing
many caravans travelling as we, at night; nothing
can cross this plain when the sun is high. From
twelve to one another halt, then up to catch our
first glimpse of the hills to which we go. The
caravans hail us as we pass, "Salaam, aleikum!"
(Peace be on you!) To which we reply, "Wa
aleikim, Salaam!" (And on you be peace!)</p>

<p>I am shown the spot where a policeman died
of thirst, and another where a Midgan fell behind
the caravan he was accompanying, and likewise
perished. From four to five we halt once more,
and, taking water from our well-filled chaguls (canvas
water-bags), make a cup of sorely needed tea. Day
is breaking so we must not loiter.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, thoroughly tired out, we ride into
Bokh, a watering-place at the foot of the Somaliland
maritime hills. The road over the plain we have
passed&mdash;we have covered sixty-five miles&mdash;should be
passable for camels only, but the wonderful little
mule carrying Mahomed, the interpreter, has trotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
beside us and enters camp as fresh as paint; that is
to say he looks no more tired, for he always looks
tired, than he did yesterday.</p>

<p>Bokh has wells, hence its importance. My tent is
pitched on a flat, stony, open piece of ground at the
foot of the hills and close to one of these wells. As
I write two girls are leaving it with goat-skins, full
of water, strapped to their shoulders. Three camels
packed with hides emerge from the bush beyond the
well, led by an elderly man who carries spear and
circular shield. He is followed by an individual
dressed in dirty cotton knickers, a French military
coat, and with head and face almost hidden by a
dirty cloak. This latter person is from Abyssinia,
and carries a Gras carbine. The camel is laden with
earthenware pots filled with ghee, cunningly packed
in bent cane guards. Now a large kafila<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;some
half-dozen men and as many women&mdash;has arrived,
and its owners are relieving the camels of skins
and ghee they bring. Loads off, the men and a
couple of women, lead the animals to the wells. In
their hands they carry home-made wooden basins
which they fill with water for the beasts to drink.
The other women are arranging the loads, bringing
firewood, or lighting the fires. Their clothes are
dirty and they seem tired, though they set so briskly
about their work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p>A lady, carrying her husband's spear and stick,
has approached to look at me. She boasts silver
ear-rings, has a string of amber beads around her
neck, wears a dirty cloth, but in spite of her clothes
looks, like all the women, clean and wholesome.
She has gone and I still watch the well. Two young
girls, unmarried&mdash;this is easily distinguished, as their
hair is uncovered by the gauze affected by married
women&mdash;have driven up some goats. It is a shallow
well, and the nimble-footed goats can get down to
the water. One black billy has already gone in,
and, as the others come up, pokes his bearded face
over the side of the well. His companions, mistaking
him for a lion, dash wildly away. We all laugh.
The two girls, with that gait peculiar to women all
the world over, run after their goats and drive them
back. Here come the sand-grouse in flocks. Before
they came a few old crows were making themselves
conspicuous, but now take a back seat. If you
could sit with me and watch the endless procession
of men, women, children, animals, and birds, coming
and going, crossing and re-crossing, from apparently
nowhere at all, you would realise how precious water
really is, be it even as filthy and evil-smelling as
from the wells here.</p>

<p>The police corporal has taken down our camel
tanks, each holding twelve gallons, and is having
them filled. To-morrow we camp at a waterless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
spot. Our allowance of water will be one gallon
each. Though not really important on this journey,
woe betide the man who tries to wangle more.
Better for him that he should steal a purse filled with
gold than a bucket measure of water, the loss of
which on some safaris might quite easily mean a
man's life.</p>

<p>The shades of night are falling swiftly, as they
always do in the tropics, but the wells are still
crowded. It has been a hot day; there has been no
shade, and my head aches; so, though the well
fascinates me&mdash;I sit at my camp table facing it and
can see every move&mdash;I shall lay down my pencil
for to-day.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>This morning the baggage camels marched at
two a.m.; we aristocrats of the riding brigade
moved out at four a.m., by which hour the numerous
caravans, camped at the wells last night, had all gone.
As we rode out of camp we passed, close to the
wells, two huge piles of stone about sixty yards in
circumference, and eight feet high. On to one of
these I climbed to find it was crater shaped.
Evidently there had been a chamber, or hollow,
underneath, the roof of which collapsing had given
the crater-shape to the top of the mound. My
escort implored me to descend. There was, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
said, a great snake living amongst the stones whom
it was wise to respect.</p>

<p>Did they know who had piled up these stones?
I asked. They did not. Perhaps the Gallas, but
no one knew.</p>

<p>There were things buried there, they said.</p>

<p>What sort of things? They could not say, but,
as they evidently held the place in awe, I relieved
their feelings by descending and mounting my camel.
Then on through the moonlight&mdash;bright as day.
On our left and right rough rocky kopjes, dotted
here and there with the typical stunted thorn trees
of Somaliland; a patch of grass here, a tuft there,
accentuates the grey monotonous rocks and stones.
Day broke to find us passing through a dry river
bed, and we routed out an old hyena, whom we
stopped to watch. He made off down the bed, then
turned, came back a few yards, stood and looked
at us; but not for long; he is suspicious and must
keep on the move&mdash;a few yards to the right, again
to the left, and halted. Now like a man bereft of
sense, with no idea of his direction, he took the hill,
rising straight out of the bed, climbed for twenty
yards, stopped to look back at us, moved away along
the side of the hill, changed his mind, came down
half-way to the dry bed, stopped again, and took
us all in with a long stare. Had we not followed
the sneaky fellow's movements we should now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
mistake him for a stone, so still he stands, so perfectly
does his colour and shape harmonise with the
rough grey boulders scattered on the hillside.</p>

<p>"Give him one shot," counsels my orderly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I reply. "He has done us no
harm. Advance!"</p>

<p>At seven, by following an easily graded but stony
track, we top the summit of the pass between the
hills above last night's camp. There are hills and
more hills ahead. A camel caravan is approaching
from the south. At its head a young girl dressed
in a cotton petticoat, with a robe draped from her
shoulders and looped up round the loins, giving
what, I believe, is described as a very full hip effect.
As she comes close I can see this effect is accentuated
by a number of parcels stored in the pocket-like
folds. A Somal woman, true to her sex, is a
perfect artist in the way she drapes, and gives effect
to, the simple clothes that cover her body.</p>

<p>From now on we pass through a gorge-like valley
over a stratum of greyish rotten rock tilted on edge.
I amuse myself by pushing away with my stick the
sharp points of rotten stone that stick up by the
side of the track over which we walk and lead the
camels. Between the grey layers of stone are occasionally
sandwiched layers of white, and the rocks
on the hillside above take on a reddish tinge, which,
though there is the scantiest of vegetation, just saves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the scene from being depressing. We pass a loaded
camel&mdash;one of ours&mdash;lying down. He insists,
despite the vigorous persuasion of his syce, in
remaining in that position. He is bored to death
with the two water-tanks he is carrying; and when
a camel makes up his mind to throw up the sponge
nothing on earth will change it. I, therefore, give
orders for the tanks to be emptied, Women from a
passing kafila rush with their bowls and ask for the
water. When it is all gone the camel is pleased to
rise and proceeds grumblingly on his way.</p>

<p>By half-past eight we have headed the baggagers
and descend onto a flat plain in a horse-shoe of hills.
Here, thank God, on the banks of a dry water-course,
are trees large enough to give us shade from
the sun, and here we halt. As I select my tree some
gerenauk run across the river-bed, and, for the sake
of the pot, I chance a snapshot. By bad luck I
wound a poor beast who disappears into the scrub.
Cursing my luck and folly, I call on my orderly to
follow with a water chagul, and come out from my
shade to go and finish off the fell work. But luck
is with me after all. Instead of a chase for hours,
as I had expected, I come up with my quarry in ten
minutes and administer the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>. My
orderly&mdash;although I am sure the animal is stone
dead, but tactfully refrain from saying so&mdash;makes
a show of finishing him off in the orthodox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Mahomedan fashion, so that the flesh may be lawful
to all true believers, and we return to camp. At two
o'clock the baggage camels are loaded and sent off;
we soon follow. We keep to the foot of the hills,
follow a dry water-course, and pass through the most
arid of country, leading our animals. At six-twenty
we are well ahead of the baggage, so halt under a
patch of low trees. There is water to be had for the
digging; we need not have carried so much water
after all.</p>

<p>Near this camp are many mounds like those at
the wells of Bokh. There also is a circular hut,
well built, the first of its kind I have seen in the
interior of Somaliland. Once a Sheikh of real
repute halted here for a few days and this hut was
built for his comfort. I can call up the scene of
the nomad Somals collecting from all sides to build
the wretched structure. It is nevertheless, to me,
a symbol of the fanatical religious fire that burns
within their bosoms. That and nothing else,
excepting perhaps an earthquake, could have moved
them voluntarily to do what is called a job of work.
They were doubtless fired by the same spirit that
inspires us to raise up loftier, nobler buildings for
the glory of God and our religion. That only a hut
resulted is typical of the great difference between
the willingness of their spirit and the strength of
their flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The name of this place is Yebil-Kên, "the place
with no grazing." But there are more trees here;
the tufts of grass are more numerous and you need
not look far for one; all the same it is a dreary spot.
Wonderful are the people who find a living
for themselves and their cattle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Last night it rained, and I had my bed carried into
the tent. We have climbed high, so the night was
not hot; for once&mdash;the first time in months&mdash;I felt
pleasantly cool. This morning the sky was cloudy,
and we did not march until daybreak. Climbing,
by an easily graded track over another pass, which
we entered at the end of the horse-shoe plain
between two steep hills, and following a water-course
across rough stony ground, we came into camp,
where cook had coffee, hot bacon and eggs, waiting
on the table.</p>

<p>Until now nearly all the people we have met have
been travelling to the coast with skins, ghee, and
other commodities to sell. This morning the country
passed through is being grazed by the Abrian
section of the Gadabursi. Several kafilas of
families on the move have passed the camp, and I
was successful in obtaining permission from the
owner of one to take a photograph. The women
hid their faces when I pointed the camera, but I
managed to get some good shots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Somals are past masters in the art of packing. It
is wonderful to behold the natty way in which a
family on the move has stowed away its household
goods and utensils. A Somal woman packs her
effects on the camels back as daintily as her more
civilised sisters do theirs in wardrobes and chests of
drawers. The wear and tear of hard travel, apart
from the difficulty in procuring manufactured utensils
suitable for the purposes required, has called into
play the ingenuity of the aboriginal man and woman.
Water vessels made from closely woven grass, and
practically unbreakable, could not be bettered, for
the work they are used for, by anything made in
Europe. The thick mats, used as camel pads, when
spread over the tent canes, packed away so neatly
on the camel's loads, keep out the hot sun better
than any canvas or cotton that has ever been produced
by the looms of Europe.</p>

<p>Everything the Somal carries is made for utility's
sake, but man's nature, be he civilised or savage,
ever craves for a little comfort over and above the
bare necessities of life. God knows these people
meet with little enough of the former. Good shade
from the hot sun should be properly classed as a
necessity. In any case, Somal mats are the last
word for the purpose.</p>

<p>Turn a European loose here, with his wife: give
him a few head of cattle; spare him the children&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
would only make his lot the more impossible;
cut him off from civilisation, and, in two months'
time, he and his wife would either be dead or on
the point of suicide. But here a Somal may thrive
and be happy. His wife will plait mats and do
practically all the work, besides bearing his children.
The man will do all the praying to God&mdash;it
is his pastime&mdash;but for it the woman has no time&mdash;and
all the fighting, should there be any. He
and his wife will wrest more than a living from this
barren country I look across, provided always that
he has the cattle. He can find everything else
needed, from the means to make fire&mdash;two sticks&mdash;to
medicine for his tummy&mdash;the leaves from a wild
plant&mdash;where the European could find nothing but
the acme of desolation and despair.</p>

<p>The Somal's life consists of one continual move
from spot to spot in search of grazing and water.
If good rains come they bring better grazing, more
water, more milk, and less work&mdash;for the wife at least.</p>

<p>Words cannot be strung together to describe the,
apparently, utter barrenness and sterility&mdash;to the
European mind&mdash;of the hundred odd miles of
country I have ridden across during the last four
days. The soil is too poor and dry to produce anything
in the nature of food for man, but Nature has
provided&mdash;not too plentifully&mdash;shrubs with deep
wide-spreading roots which store up the moisture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in bulb-like receptacles and so tide the plant over the
worst and hottest days of the year. Thus there are
green nourishing leaves for the hardy cattle to eat
when all else is dead. Even the deep roots of the
grass are provided with nodules to store up moisture
that the plants may live. And all these plants know
the secret of extracting from this apparently sterile
earth the richest ingredient necessary for the
sustenance of cattle and camels. Further, centuries
of training and natural selection have evolved a
beast, be it camel, cow, horse, sheep, or goat, that
is capable of living through drought and conditions
that would soon prove fatal to animals from fatter
lands. These Somal-bred animals can pass over
stretches necessitating several days' journey without
water, carrying on their backs the water to drink,
in their udders the rich milk&mdash;food as well as drink&mdash;for
man, their master, and his children. In such
country as this, it would be plagiarism to attempt
to describe what has so often been described before.
The rainy season, compared with that of more
favoured parts of the world, appears as little short
of a drought; and a drought here, similarly compared,
might well be classed as "hell let loose."</p>

<p>To-day we are to commence a further ascent into
a more favoured land. Why these plain-dwellers
and low-hill men have not done the same, and stayed
on the cool high plateaux, blessed with a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fair soil and better watered, is one of those
puzzles in life it is impossible to solve.</p>

<p>The camel sowars are packed, and ready to move
on the afternoon's trek. The road is stony as we
walk between the hills. Since that time recorded in
the Book of Genesis God has not laid His hand
here. The earth's crust has been burst through and
over-run by a molten mass spewed forth from her
bowels. Here one walks over rough sharp stones
that play havoc with the boots; there on a concrete-like
conglomerate of white or pinkish stone. The
hills have been scoured in past ages by water-courses
until their very vitals, masses of grey rock strata
tilted on edge from which great lumps have been
torn and tossed in broken fragments to the valley
below, have been shamelessly exposed. Time has
been pitilessly and steadily crumbling away these
sharp, skeleton-like protrusions into a mantle of
powder and small stones, now falling over, and
gradually hiding, the gaping wounds. And, as the
channels of the torrents that have worked this chaos
fell lower and lower, the water, baulked of its prey,
turned to vent its spite on the poor stones torn from
the heights above. Over and over it has rolled
them, ground them together, rubbed them with
sand, worked around them until worn into smooth
boulders. They are now barely recognisable as
being of the mother rock above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Then suddenly, from out of all this we come to
a stream, Dur-dur-'ad, "the White Running
Water." Exactly one year ago I sat on the banks
of a stream that ran down the slopes of Mount
Elgon. Since then I have been to England and
seen running water&mdash;if I except the Thames&mdash;only
from the windows of a railway carriage. What
a joy is running water, and how many people know
it? How many people living by streams take them
for granted, and so miss more than the man who
rarely sees them. For, believe me, it is to the latter
that the babbling waters talk and tell most.</p>

<p>And the waters of Dur-dur-'ad, to-day, found a
ready and willing listener, who drank with pleasure
of their prattling music. Does it matter, excepting
to me, what they said? Not long ago I read that
a man should mark out his life's course with posts,
keeping in sight only one at a time. And I, reading
this, promised myself that the last goal-post on my
course should be a spring. A spring shaded with
cool willow trees; the waters to be not so clouded but
that a man, or a little child, leaning over might see
his image within.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Last night they told me that it was unsafe to march
before daylight, as the camp vicinity was infested
with lions, "bad lions." That meant that the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
were tired and wanted rest, so we arranged to march
at daylight. And we marched at nine a.m. Dur-dur-'ad
came down in spate during the night, and as
the road crosses and recrosses beyond the camping
place, we waited for the torrent to fall, which it did
as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p>We made up river for five miles; the road has
certainly been constructed ages ago by a people
possessing some degree of civilisation. Though
rough and stony it is well graded. The scenery is
wild and rugged but grand in its way. Once we
passed a man and woman sitting on the rocks.
The woman was unmarried, unusual at her age,
which looked to be every second of twenty-seven
years. She consented to stand for her photograph.
I was, she said, the first European she had set
eyes upon. I should have been better pleased had
she made less fuss about it; for she covered her
face with her hands, called out "Oo-oo-oo-ooh!"
and shook with laughter at my appearance.</p>

<p>This neighbourhood is being grazed, and on all
the hillsides we see as we pass young girls herding
the sheep and goats, and hear them calling to each
other. And now we come to the spot where we
leave Dur-dur-'ad for good and here we shall loiter
for an hour. The baggage camels arrive and halt
just long enough to fill the water-tanks, then, on
they go, leaving us alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Mahomed Gaileh, Akil of the Gadabursi Mahadasan,
appears; he is accompanied by a Mullah,
who carries a yellow flag on which is embroidered
a crescent and five stars in crimson. We exchange
greetings and news. Will I accept the sheep the
Akil has brought as a present? "No," I answer,
I regret to say I shall not, but thank Mahomed just
the same. I most highly appreciate his kindness in
thinking of our commissariat. Indeed, I convey to
him the fact that I shall for ever after look upon
him as a man who gave me a sheep that I was
unfortunately unable to take away. The Mullah
sits cross-legged, telling his beads, with his eyes ever
on my face. He desists once to give me an interesting
piece of information. Three hours' away from
here, but off our road, is a ruined town. The walls
of the houses are still standing, and the mortar used
to bind the stones together, he says, has set very
hard. He does not know what it is made of, but
it looks like cement. Probably a town like Harrar.
No one knows who built it.</p>

<p>"Good-bye! Thanks so much for the sheep," I
call as I ride off, knowing quite well that Mahomed
Gaileh is saying to himself, "And thank Allah you
did not take it."</p>

<p>From now on we pass through rougher, wilder
country, but there is more vegetation. Now the
easily graded track drops precipitously into a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ravine, up which we turn and climb. There are
steep rocky walls on our right and left. The floor
of the ravine rises higher and higher; the walls
come lower and lower, until we stand on the summit
of a narrow ridge. Bearing to the left we follow the
ridge for five minutes and come into camp. It is
half-past six o'clock, and as the sun goes down the
evening turns chilly. I sit wrapped up in a trench
coat and order a fire. Mahomed, the interpreter,
comes to say that as the lions are <em>very</em> bad, it will
not be safe to leave camp before daybreak; to which,
remembering how many lions came last night, I
reply, "Bow-wow." The true reason, and one with
which I am entirely in sympathy, is that, after the
hot plains, they find the early morning air up here
bitterly cold.</p>

<p>And why can't they tell me that is the reason?
Because they like to pose as hardy fellows.
Because, perhaps, they fear I might like to pose as
a hardy fellow, too, and turn them all out to shiver
whilst I walk round in my warm clothes. So it is
arranged to the satisfaction of all parties that we
march at daylight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Two easy hours' riding from here there's a
camp; and in that camp are four Sahibs, Wallah."</p>

<p>This to me at nine o'clock last night from
Mahomed, the interpreter. Somals have no idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
distance or time, and my experience has been that
statements from them concerning the movements or
whereabouts of other people are invariably unreliable.
A simple statement like the foregoing
could not be accepted without careful examination.
Yet, should there really be four Sahibs ahead, they
are undoubtedly the officers I am travelling to meet
at Hargeisa, and I should go to their camp.</p>

<p>"You say there are four Sahibs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; people have arrived from their camp who
saw them to-day."</p>

<p>"And are they on the Hargeisa road?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>At six a.m. this morning after a cup of hot tea we
rode for two solid, steady hours till we came to the
Hargeisa plateau. Turning sharp right we rode
away from the Hargeisa track. I was suspicious,
but said nothing until we met a Bedouin Somal. To
my question he replied that he had come from a
police camp about three hours' away; that with
trotting camels we should arrive there in two hours,
but the road was rough.</p>

<p>And had he seen anything of four Sahibs? No!
He saw one, an officer with a troop of M.I., who
went away yesterday morning.</p>

<p>And is this the Hargeisa road? No, it is not;
we have left it, but there is another road from the
police camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>It was useless showing temper. I told Mahomed,
the interpreter, we would ride back to the Hargeisa
road and wait for the baggage camels. Mahomed,
the interpreter, told me that that was impossible,
because the baggage camels, having left the Hargeisa
road at the camp, were following an entirely
different road to the one we had come by. We went
on to the police camp, as Mahomed had all along
intended, and arrived at noon.</p>

<p>"And now," said I, "I shall have a cup of tea
and some biscuits."</p>

<p>Every day since leaving Zeila we had carried the
articles necessary for such a meal in our saddle-bags,
but to-day they had been left behind. Why?
Because Mahomed, the interpreter, and my boy
arranged that I should lunch with the four Sahibs
who are not here.</p>

<p>We are now on a high plateau. The country is
undulating, the soil fair and the grazing good.
There are many patches of cultivation, the first I
have seen in Somaliland. Ughaz Elmi Warfa
(Ughaz is a title), the head of the Gadabursi tribe,
came to see me. He was accompanied by a party
of horse and foot men. The Ughaz, a tall, crafty-looking
old man, sat beside me on a deck chair,
produced by the Somal jemadar in charge of the
police post; whilst his men gave a demonstration.
First, one by one, came the horsemen at full gallop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to about three yards away from where I sat, and just
as a collision seemed inevitable the poor little brutes
of ponies were pulled on to their haunches. For the
horses' sake I begged this should stop. Then the
horsemen advanced in line and at a walk, halting in
front of me. One of them sang that they were the
people who lived on the border, had been looted
by the Amhara, had no peace; stood between two
men, and should they talk to the man before them
the other kicked them from behind. Theirs was
indeed a hard lot. The man who sang was a
wild-looking fellow with fuzzy-wuzzy hair. He
carried a spear and shield. Personally speaking,
I should not choose him as a good subject to
kick from behind, but if I lived with him, and
he sang much, I should be strongly tempted to
do so.</p>

<p>The horsemen dismounted, came forward, shook
hands, turned away and off-saddled. This done, they
joined the footmen waiting a hundred paces away.
There was a wait of some minutes whilst a warrior
was being persuaded to come out and lead the
dance. When I was sufficiently impressed with his
importance he stepped out in front of his comrades
who were standing in line. Stepping it nimbly up
and down before them as they sang, he performed
some quite clever evolutions. At regular intervals
he would rush forward, stab his spear in the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
sink on his knees, and, bending his body right back,
act the wounded warrior. Such was the signal for
the line to advance towards him with a rush, and
thus he led it close to my chair. Now and again a
warrior carrying his spear at the charge would run
forward, stop before me, and salute with the word
"<i>Mutt</i>." All this for half an hour, when I
politely requested it should cease.</p>

<p>"Just one more dance," said the Ughaz as he
waved the line back.</p>

<p>It retired and various other people came before it
to dance&mdash;quite well too. A number of women had
collected behind the men. I could see them kneeling
to look between the latter's legs at me. Soon
after <em>the</em> dancer came out, when the women
forgot to look at me, so interested were they in him.
Up and down he pirouetted, juggling with his spear
and shield. He rushed madly forward, stopped
with a jerk, bent his body back to such an extent
that it appeared as though his back-bone must snap,
and I was really quite concerned. The dancer is
supposed to be dying; his long black hair covers
his face; it is suddenly brushed aside to show him
in convulsions; his body writhes like a snake's; he
is dying hard. A man runs out with drawn dagger
in hand to finish the business. A tall fellow this.
Straddling the body of the dying man he cuts
his throat&mdash;in pantomime. The performance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
sufficiently realistic to make my blood curdle, and
I am relieved when it ends.</p>

<p>There is a great gathering of people here. I
have met a man who has just killed his own brother.
A rascal, this latter, who, until a few weeks since,
lived on the Abyssinian border, where he was able
to raid and loot with impunity. His brother&mdash;this
man whom I have just met&mdash;went out with his father
to look for the robber, for they were tired of his
escapades. They came upon him in Abyssinian
territory, and as he showed fight the man now before
me slashed him on the back of the neck with his
dagger. The robber fell to the ground; the horror-stricken
father rushed to the side of his fallen son,
who, with his last breath, plunged his dagger in the
old man's side. Such an incident excites no
comment on this wild Somali-Abyssinian border,
near which our camp now stands.</p>

<p>Up to now we have come due South except when
wandering through the hills, and our road onward
lies across sixty miles of plateau. The rains are
here and the country is green. There is much that
would tempt the artist to loiter with pencil or brush.
That river bank, for instance, lined with trees.
Beyond those trees are smaller trees, and shrubs
covered with leaves. Aloes throw up miniature
poles bedizened with red flowers. Beyond again,
open ground, showing yellow through the patches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
green grass. Over there a Gadabursi or a Habr
Awwal village, for here many natives have taken to
growing jowari, and, after the manner of agriculturists,
herd together. Near the village deep green
leafless plants that point a thousand fingers at the
sky, so blue overhead. What a beautiful picture it
would all make!</p>

<p>But I, who know it, see beneath the beauty.
Those aloes with the red-hot pikers are armed with
spikes and sharp-hooked thorns to tear your flesh in
ribands. Their very colour, if one looks closely,
is suggestive of snakes and death, not brightness
and life. The grass will soon die, and the yellow
ground is but a crust of harsh sand that has no
substance. The agriculturists who would wrest a
living from out it have a hard row to hoe to procure
even the bare wherewithal to live. Beautiful it is,
yet withal a thin, harsh, cruel land.</p>

<p>We cover the sixty miles to Hargeisa in two clear
days, and ride into the usual African up-country
town. Here is the D.C.'s Court, the police lines,
the prison and the D.C.'s house. Beyond them the
native town; a town of sticks, straw and native mats,
with a few sun-dried brick houses, and one of stone.
Between all this is a natural park; a park on the
banks of a waterless river-bed; a park filled with
the thorn trees, the aloes in flower, and the plant
with the thousands of fingers. Strangely enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
here is a European lady as well, who sits beneath
a huge mimosa tree and puts them all into a picture.
She says they are beautiful.</p>

<p>It is one hundred and twenty miles as the crow
flies to Zeila, and nearly two hundred by the road
we have come. There is a mail waiting; it has
arrived by Berbera, and links us up with the outer
world, which after all, and in these days, is not so
far away. Here, for the first time in four months,
I speak to an Englishman, and, when it is time to
pack up for the return journey to Zeila, I leave
Hargeisa with regret.</p>

<h3>THE BREAKING OF THE MAD MULLAH</h3>

<blockquote>

Unit, R.A.F., at Berbera&mdash;Details and arrangements&mdash;Mullah
miracles&mdash;Aeroplane scouting&mdash;Friendlies&mdash;R.A.F.

<p>In 1919 British Somaliland was roughly divided&mdash;politically&mdash;into
two separate territories, the East
and the West. The former dominated by one saturnine
personality, the Mad Mullah, who rarely (of late
years never) intruded into the more peaceful, if more
subtle, situation of the West.</p>

<p>Not one day since I landed in Somaliland has
passed without my running up against one or more
of the victims of the Mullah, now reported to be
getting old, and so stout as to be almost inactive.
On trek I could not sit down to breakfast without
hearing the wail of some poor woman or child
outside the encampment. "Sahib! Sahib! for the
love of God! A bite of food for a poor meskin!"
Daily in the Court Room wrecks of women and
children came before me for relief. Almost invariably
I found, on the strictest inquiries being made
into their cases, that their villages had been
destroyed, their property looted, their men-folk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
killed, by the murdering gang of thieves who carried
out incessantly the merciless policy of this awful
man. In desperation they had roamed across
country, ever making away from the territory where
the terror reigned. How the Mullah had put to the
sword the men, women, and children of one whole
section of a tribe because, whilst being shown over
a fort in the course of construction by their headman,
a wooden beam had fallen and broken his arm,
was related to me a few days before she died by a
poor woman, one of the few survivors.</p>

<p>I had read much of the man before I came to
Somaliland, and rather admired what I imagined to
be his sporting character. But since I have learned
enough about him at first hand, and have been so
shocked at the misery, caused by this fiend, that is
ever being brought to my notice, the very mention
of his name causes my blood to boil.</p>

<p>It was in the West, and in the month of October,
1919, that I found myself deeply involved in nothing
more exciting than the hearing of divorce cases,
marriage disputes, petty loots, and homicides. In
fact occupied with the thousand and one affairs,
the settlement of which goes to make up the greater
part of the routine work in the daily life of a
District Commissioner in the Zeila District of British
Somaliland.</p>

<p>Into the midst of all this came a mail, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
mail a letter addressed to me from the Officer Commanding
Troops (also, at that moment, administering
the Government) asking if I would take over the
organisation of the supply and transport for certain
contemplated operations against the "Mad Mullah."
My reply, though couched in more official language,
can be summed up briefly as, "<em>Rather!</em>"</p>

<p>In the course of this narrative, and after having
thus explained my rôle in the expedition, I do not
propose to do any more than set forth such events
and happenings as came to my personal notice, or
with which I naturally became conversant as being in
close touch with the officers, or units, of whom I
write. This is not a disquisition or treatise on how
to run Supply and Transport in Somaliland, though
a by-no-means unexciting subject.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of November there was landed at
Berbera the first consignment of aerial bombs.
These were followed, on the 13th of November, by
Colonel R. Gordon, C.M.G., commanding No. 2
Unit, Royal Air Force, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Tyrell, D.S.O., who was responsible for the R.A.F.
medical arrangements. Shortly afterwards the first
contingent of the 6th King's African Rifles, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Wilkinson, D.S.O., landed at
Las Khorai, where they were joined later by the
remainder of the battalion; about eight hundred and
fifty rifles all told. The temporary garrison at Las<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Khorai, composed of four hundred and forty rifles&mdash;the
101st Grenadiers, Indian Army&mdash;evacuated
Las Khorai and proceeded by sea to Berbera, thence
to Las Dureh. It had at first been decided to use
Las Khorai as the base from which the R.A.F.
should commence operations, but, owing to the prevalence
of wind and dust storms at that port, this
plan was given up, and the base was fixed on&mdash;much
to my regret as it meant land transport&mdash;at El-dur-Elan.
By Christmas-time preparations were well
advanced, and, in spite of the lack of facilities,
the R.A.F. were well up to time in their preparations
for the attack, planned to take place early in
January.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="BERBERA" id="BERBERA"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_202fp.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="BERBERA" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BERBERA TOWN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the 12th of January it was certain that the
aeroplanes would be ready to commence operations
on the 21st. The position was then as follows:&mdash;the
Mullah was reported at Medishe, about eight
miles North West of Jidali. The country he held
can very roughly be summarised as that in the
vicinity of his more important fortified posts, namely
Garabghari, Jidali, Medishe and Baran, with a clear
run to the East, water, which is scarce, permitting:
and a clear run to the South, to Tale, the largest and
most strongly fortified position of all. There were
many other minor forts, but I believe I have mentioned
the principal ones.</p>

<p>Up to this time the Military Policy had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
make preparations as unostentatiously as possible, so
that the Mullah would not take fright and move off
from Medishe. His doing so would have necessitated
a complete rearrangement of plans, so telling
heavily on the transport arrangements&mdash;an important
consideration. The assembling of the aeroplanes at
Berbera was nearing completion, and trial flights to
the West were being made. The reason why the
planes were not tried to the Eastward is obvious, but
the native population believed they were prevented
from doing so by the supernatural power of the
Mullah, who had, they said, cast a spell over the
machines, so barring them from using the aerial
route over the town of Berbera (East of the R.A.F.
Camp) or above the hills to the South-East. As
a proof of what the Mullah could do in this direction
I have heard intelligent natives state that on a
certain occasion the old man pointed out three crows,
high in the air, to his followers, directing them to
watch that which was about to happen. The three
crows fell dead to the ground. A holy man, who
could bring down birds by reciting a verse from the
Koran, the method employed, was not likely to be
troubled by aeroplanes. But to return to the disposition
of the military forces on the 12th of January.</p>

<p>The 101st Grenadiers had occupied El-dur-Elan,
where a dump of stores for all arms had been established.
The Somaliland Camel Corps, leaving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
small dismounted detachment at headquarters,
Burao, was moving on the same point, where a
detachment of R.A.F. was busily preparing the
aerodrome, workshops and camp necessary for their
Corps. The Somaliland Field Force Field Hospital,
and the R.A.F. Field Hospital, were likewise
established at the same point. The King's African
Rifles had established their base at Musha Aled,
and, in spite of the fact that, owing to lack of steamer
transport, great difficulty was experienced in supplying
them with transport camels, they were practically
ready to move.</p>

<p>At Berbera the R.A.F. were feverishly engaged
in the assembling and tuning up of the ten fighting
two-seaters, and the two ambulance planes that had
been landed from H.M.S. <i>Ark Royal</i>. In addition
to this work they had prepared emergency landing
grounds and established dumps at Las Khorai,
Burao, and Eil Dab.</p>

<p>The P.W.D., Somaliland, was pushing on as
quickly as possible with the work of making the track
between Berbera and Las Dureh passable for motorcars,
which were not, however, used for transport for
the expedition. They were found most useful in
carrying European ranks over the first, and worst,
stage of the journey between Berbera and Las
Dureh. A dry barren terrain, over which they were
never able to proceed farther than within a few miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of Hagal, about forty-five miles out. From here the
almost impossible country for cars became quite
impossible, unless most expensive works were
undertaken.</p>

<p>On the 16th of January, His Excellency the
Governor left Berbera for El-dur-Elan, and on the
following day, accompanied by the Director of
Public Works, I followed.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January and at seven a.m. I
arrived at El-dur-Elan, to find that the Camel Corps
and the 101st Grenadiers had moved on to El
Afweina with the bulk of supplies intended for the
land forces. The only troops at El-dur-Elan were
seventy rifles of the 101st Grenadiers, and His
Excellency's bodyguard. His Excellency would not
grant me permission to proceed farther without an
adequate escort, so that I had a good opportunity of
seeing the first machines arrive at El-dur-Elan from
Berbera, and likewise the first flight, timed for the
21st, that was to break for ever the power of the
Mad Mullah in British Somaliland.</p>

<p>On the 21st, although the machines were not
completely assembled, the R.A.F. preparations were
sufficiently advanced to commence operations, the
scheme of which was roughly as follows. Medishe,
where the Mullah was known to be, was to be
bombed first. The Camel Corps, which had left
El-dur-Elan on the 19th, was to move forward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
take Jidali, thus cutting off any concerted move to
the South. A large party of friendlies under Captain
Gibb had been collected to the South, to keep a
sharp look-out for scattered groups of fugitives and
stock, and most particularly to intercept the Mullah
himself should he succeed, as was considered highly
probable, in breaking South for Tale. These
friendlies had suffered severely at the Mullah's hands
for years, and were dying to see the last of him.
They, as subsequently transpired, gave a good
account of themselves.</p>

<p>The transport of the Camel Corps, escorted by
the 101st Grenadiers, was to move forward from
El Afweina towards Jidali, when opportunity
offered and the situation developed. The K.A.R.,
from Musha Aled, were to attend to the fortress of
Baran, which they approached over a difficult and
precipitous escarpment.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, the 21st, the first four
aeroplanes got away from El-dur-Elan, and how
anxiously their return was awaited at the Camp is
beyond the power of my pen to describe. When the
first faint drone of engines was heard there was a
general rush for the "drome." Only two machines
had returned and they reported as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On flying out four smoke signals, lit by Somali
scouts to mark the vicinity of the dervish cattle, had
been readily found, but, shortly afterwards, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the planes was seen to be in trouble and heading for
the sea. This machine and the two pilots, who had
returned, followed, until they were assured it had a
good chance of landing either at Las Khorai or on
the sea-coast, when they returned. We learned
later it had landed safely at Las Khorai.</p>

<p>They had not seen Medishe, or any of the
Mullah's forts. The fourth plane, which had not
returned, left them when over the hills, and had
swung Eastwards, after the first machine was in
difficulty. All the men who listened to the report,
and who knew Somaliland, offered up a silent prayer
that her pilot and observer were safe or dead, and
had not been delivered into the merciless hands of
the Mad Mullah.</p>

<p>But soon the faint drone of the missing plane was
heard. It landed safely, and reported that it had
found and bombed Medishe. The observer said the
place was strongly held, and defended by five stone
tower-like forts. He could not say what damage had
been done, but he had made direct hits, causing
great confusion amongst the garrison. The group
of officers broke up, now well satisfied, and there
was a feeling all round that the aeroplanes were
going to justify their existence.</p>

<p>But, on Thursday morning, when they started out
again, the pilot who had bombed Medishe the day
before was forced to descend, and the planes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
went on again failed to locate Medishe, for the very
good reason, I believe, that it had only been fixed
approximately (on native information) on the maps
supplied to the expedition.</p>

<p>At this stage the wireless communications between
the King's African Rifles, the O.C. Somaliland
Field Force, and the R.A.F. at El-dur-Elan broke
down, or were working badly. It was an anxious
time, and when three aeroplanes, which went out in
the afternoon, returned to report that they had
located, and heavily bombed, the Mullah's stronghold,
there was general rejoicing.</p>

<p>On Saturday the aeroplanes again visited
Medishe, which they believed had been severely
dealt with, went on and bombed Jidali.</p>

<p>On the same day I left by aeroplane for Al
Afweina, where I assumed command of the transport
and dismounted column, marched on Sunday
for Jidali, which we reached on Thursday, the 29th,
after a hard trek.</p>

<p>An incident during this trek, though it was not
amusing at the moment, is not without its humorous
side. The camel transport, consisting of fourteen
companies, was able to march in fairly good formation&mdash;line
of companies in single file&mdash;but, at one
point, whilst crossing a narrow neck, was thrown into
some confusion on the rough narrow track it was
forced to converge upon, so that it looked not unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
a mob of dervish pack-camels. At this particular
moment an aeroplane glided over the hills on our
right, and began to take some interest in our movements.
It had been arranged that all troops should
carry several pieces of white cloth which, when
spread on the ground, would convey to the pilots of
the R.A.F. who it was they were observing from the
air. But, as so often happens with such arrangements,
I found that, when we wanted our signalling
apparatus, it was mixed up with the transport. The
aeroplane, swooping right across us, had turned, and
was coming up again for what appeared to our
nervous minds might strike the pilot as the target of
a lifetime. The 101st Grenadiers had brought a
"Very Light" pistol with them. This weapon was
hastily loaded, but before it could be discharged the
observer dropped&mdash;not a bomb&mdash;but a letter containing
orders from the O.C., Somaliland Field
Force.</p>

<p>As the coloured post-bag with its gay streamers
floated through the air, the semi-savage camel
attendants, who had heard of the awful effect of
bombs, stood rooted to the ground with terror.
There was a gasp of relief when the bag harmlessly
struck the earth without exploding. I believe we
should have fired a green light, but just for luck,
and to show our independence, we fired two red
lights at the plane, which answered with a green as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
it circled away. Speaking for myself, I realised for
the first time what "wind up" really means. I
had it!</p>

<p>At Jidali we were met by the O.C. Somaliland
Field Force, Colonel Summers, in person, who
showed us into camp and made us <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</i> with
the situation. Jidali had been attacked by the Camel
Corps. The three-inch Stokes guns were brought
into play, and shells dropped on the roof of the fort
in the late evening. Early next morning it was
found that the enemy had disappeared.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival orders were issued for a
move on Medishe, to be followed by a drive through
the hills, but, about midday, on Friday, the 30th
January, as I was standing in our lines, the Colonel
walked quietly up to me and stated that he had
information which led him to believe the Mullah had
escaped South towards Tale, and that he was
launching the Camel Corps in pursuit. As he was
accompanying them for a certain distance, until he
was in a more central position owing to the change
of situation, I was to command at Jidali until the
arrival of the K.A.R., which had been ordered up
from Baran. I could see that, though he was not
going to commit himself as to the position at Jidali,
he believed the dervish power on the Las Khorai
escarpment was broken.</p>

<p>That evening the Camel Corps marched on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was to end up in one of the finest rides, and most
successful operations, in its history.</p>

<p>The next morning, following a consultation with
the O.C. 101st Grenadiers, I decided to occupy
Medishe. Accordingly, Captain Cross marched
with a party of the Grenadiers, and about two hours
later we received a helio message stating that he had
entered the place, without much opposition, and
captured vast quantities of stores. Meanwhile I
busied myself with the prisoners left behind by the
Camel Corps, from whom I learned the following
facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 21st instant the Mullah, who was well
aware of the pending operations, heard the hum of
the aeroplanes, and, with most of his head-men, went
out in the open to observe them. Medishe, being
in a narrow valley, was not "spotted" by the planes
they passed to the West, but the dervishes had a
clear view of the machines.</p>

<p>"Look," said the Mullah, "Allah has sent these
great birds as a sign to me and the faithful,"
upon which the planes disappeared. But one
came back, and again the Mullah addressed his
followers.</p>

<p>"Indeed, but God has sent this one great bird
back to me!"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="AT" id="AT"></a>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Swish&mdash;whew-w-w bang! The observer above had
pulled the lever, and the first bomb burst in Medishe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The magic of the Mad Mullah, that had for so
long held his followers together, was useless against
the magic of the bird-men above. This was the first
bomb that broke the dervish cause, for, though it
did not kill the Mullah, it came so near doing so that
the old villain was thoroughly demoralised, and
completely lost his head. His nephew, the Amir
Abdillai, a powerful dervish, was killed by his side,
and his Madness's clothes catching fire, he turned
and ran for his life to the funk-holes he had prepared
in the caves of a ravine. From these he did not
reappear until he fled, a few hours later, on learning
that the Camel Corps had arrived at Jidali, a
thoroughly broken and discredited man.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the bulk of the dervish troops were
frustrated in an attempt to get away their camels
loaded with their worldly goods, by the reappearance
of the aeroplanes, which put in some excellent work
with the machine guns. It was then that the Mullah
adopted the policy of every man for himself, and
showed the others how to do it.</p>

<p>His baggage camels, loaded with personal effects
and two Maxim guns captured from the British in
past wars, he decided should follow on behind,
whilst he made his way South with some of his wives
and female relations, and a party of mounted fighting
men. Among the latter was a man called Ibrahim,
his wife and sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>As the party left the hills at night for the open
plateau, Ibrahim slipped off his pony, permitted his
wife to pass, but as his sister rode up, silently
pressed her big toe. The lady dismounted from
her pony, allowing the cavalcade to move on.</p>

<p>Ibrahim, and his sister, reported to Colonel
Summers that the Mullah had gone.</p>

<p>The lady informed me that the Mullah had
changed his mind about the Maxim guns and had
sent instructions that they were to be hidden in a
cave at Helas, where they were later discovered by
Somali scouts and handed to the O.C. King's
African Rifles. It was discovered that one of these
was the identical gun captured from the regiment
when Colonel Plunkett met with disaster in 1906.
Thus did Time bring revenge, and I was proud
that my old regiment, fourteen years later, was there
to receive back one of the very few guns it had lost
in action.</p>

<p>On the 3rd February, Captain Cross returned
from Medishe, bringing in as loot five hundred and
twenty-two rifles and much native equipment and
stores. As I had flown from El-dur-Elan to Al
Afwenia I had been obliged to leave my camp
equipment behind, and was overjoyed to find,
amongst the latter, several pots, two good frying-pans
and a tea kettle. There was also, amongst
other things, a sextant marked with an R.N. officer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
name; part of the diary of the German, Emil Kirsch,
who, in 1916, was sent by Lij Yassu, the fugitive
ex-king of Abyssinia, to repair the Mullah's
machine guns and rifles. Swords, revolvers, double-barrelled
pistols, one of which bore the name of a
well-known gunmaker in the Strand; every make of
rifle known in Europe was there for the curio-hunter
to annex. Cross reported that Medishe had been
evacuated hurriedly, and there was no doubt that the
dervishes were thoroughly demoralised. He was
much impressed by the strength of the place, the
excellent buildings and the general sanitary arrangements.
A dam had been built across the stream, and
an excellent garden had been laid out. There was
no doubt about it, he stated, that the Mullah was
a thoroughly capable man.</p>

<p>Before leaving Medishe the Grenadiers razed the
forts to the ground with gun cotton. The fort at
Jidali, however, was less easy to dispose of, and
successfully resisted several attempts to blow it up.
The stone walls were nine feet thick, solidly built,
and it would have required heavy artillery to have
made much impression upon it. The roof, the
weakest part of the structure, successfully withstood
the Stokes bombs aimed at it by the Camel Corps.
Jidali Fort is similar to all other forts built by the
Mullah. Inside it is a perfect rabbit warren among
which it would have been highly dangerous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the throwers themselves had hand-grenades been
used.</p>

<p>In one of the forts at Medishe Cross found a
particularly gruesome sight, and typical of the
methods of the Mad Mullah. At the end of a rope,
suspended from the roof over a slow fire, hung by
the waist, were the remains of a dervish who had
thus been done to death for some petty crime or
neglect of duty.</p>

<p>Shortly after Cross's return Ibrahim's wife
arrived. On learning of her husband's defection the
dervishes had stripped and beaten her, but sighting
the planes, had abandoned her to die. She was
followed by a stream of dervish women and children
who stated that the men refused to give them food,
and had ordered them to shift for themselves.
Amongst them were many slave women dragging
at their ankles heavy chains with weights attached.
They were soon set free, and though our
commissariat arrangements were strained to breaking
point we did the best we could for them, and
all the women were cared for.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the 2nd of February the King's
African Rifles arrived at Jidali from Baran. This
latter fort had put up a stiff fight. Finding that the
loopholes of the fort restricted the line of fire to the
front, and did not allow for angle fire, the officer
commanding had advanced on each side at an angle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
suffering no serious casualties. For two days the
beleaguered garrison held out under a heavy fire
from Stokes guns, which dropped their bombs on
the roof, though making no impression whatever.
All loopholes, and the parapets, were commanded
by the K.A.R. machine guns. Finding that the
firing from the fort had weakened a party was
pushed up to the door, against which a case of
gun cotton was exploded, without effect. At last,
apparently only one of the defenders was left alive,
and the besiegers, who had drawn in, demanded
his surrender, assuring him his life was safe.</p>

<p>"I shall surrender," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then throw your rifle and belt over the walls,"
he was ordered.</p>

<p>The dervish complied, but as an askari ran up
to collect it, seized another rifle and shot the soldier
through the back.</p>

<p>And that was the end of Baran. Clean fighters,
enraged by this act of treachery, and as one man,
the K.A.R. sprang to their feet, and no door built
by the hand of man could deny them their revenge.</p>

<p>It was found later that, though the firing from
inside the fort had slackened, it was not owing to the
casualties suffered by the dervishes from direct hits.
The concussion of the exploding Stokes bombs on
the roof had stunned the defenders, who, though
treacherous murderers of women and of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
children, apostles of the doctrine of frightfulness as
we understand them, yet proved themselves, in this
little fight, to be brave men.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the K.A.R., at Jidali, the
dismounted column left on its return march. It was
obvious that the escarpment above Las Khorai&mdash;the
plateau around Jidali stretching far to the
South which holds the best grazing grounds in
Somaliland&mdash;was free of dervishes, and once more,
after many years, accessible to the poor wretches
of friendlies who had been driven forth like pariahs
from their beloved haunts by that robber-tiger,
Hassan Abdullah, the Mad Mullah. It is indeed
a splendid country for the pastoralist, in spite of
the burning days and the bitterly cold nights&mdash;nights
during which the hardiest European, covered
by three or four good blankets, finds it hard to keep
warm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we learned from fugitives that the
Mullahs baggage had been captured: that the
aeroplanes had harassed his fleeing stock, which
ran at last into a transport column, under Captain
Allden, at Eil Der, and was ignominiously captured
after a sharp fight. Tale the wretched old man had
succeeded in entering, but the Camel Corps was
hard on his heels, and the friendlies, under Captain
Gibb, were at the gates.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JIDALI FORT FROM THE GROUND.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>By permission of the Air Ministry.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the wireless we learned, by intercepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
messages, that Tale had been attacked by the airmen,
who reported it as a very strongly fortified centre,
consisting of one very large and five other forts
encircling the village, which was composed of native
gurgis (Somal tents or wigwams) and a large number
of huts. Letters and messages were dropped in its
vicinity. Previously a machine had spotted about
one hundred ponies and dervishes at Daringahiye,
near Al Afweina, believed to belong to the Mullah's
party, and, coming down to one hundred feet above,
had scattered them in all directions. The country
being intersected with deep nullahs favoured small
parties of fugitives in their attempt to escape, but
no large body of men could hope to get away
unharassed.</p>

<p>We, who had seen Medishe, realised that it was
now only a question of days before the "show"
would be over, and when, on the 12th February, I
entered Al Afweina I surmised correctly that the
work concerning myself mostly was that of winding
up the transport, and getting rid of the large dumps
of stores collected there, and at El-dur-Elan. A
few days later I received the necessary orders to
proceed with this clearing up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to return to the Somaliland Camel
Corps and the friendlies, the latter of whom were
watching the gates of Tale, where the Mullah was
now definitely located. On the night of the 5/6th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
February, in a fight outside the walls, Haji Sudi
and Ibrahim Boghl, two of the dervish leaders,
right-hand men of the Mullah, were killed. No
serious attack was made on the forts by our mounted
men, as, had they been seriously held, the Government
troops must have suffered heavy casualties; a
most serious matter in a country like Somaliland,
owing to the lack of conveniences and difficulty of
transport.</p>

<p>The Camel Corps policy was to play a waiting
game, and on Monday, the 9th February, when it
was some miles away at a water hole, the dervishes,
seizing their opportunity, launched an attack on the
friendlies watching them. During the fighting the
Mullah escaped, and shortly before the Camel
Corps arrived on the scene, by which time it was
too dark to follow on his tracks. Dismounted
scouts were sent out and next morning, at dawn,
the mounted troops picking up the tracks from the
friendlies some four or five miles on, turned North
East towards Lower Halin, which they passed, and
arrived, on Tuesday evening, at an unknown well
some forty-eight miles from their starting point.
Starting early on Wednesday they arrived, at three-forty-five
p.m., at Bihan on a hot scent, having
captured en route the Mullah's wives, children and
near relatives, during a sharp running fight with the
escort of thirty mounted men, all of whom were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
killed, their ponies and rifles being captured. It
had been ascertained at Halin, on the previous day,
that a party of dervishes had branched off from the
main body; the Camel Corps therefore detached a
party of fifteen rifles in pursuit.</p>

<p>On Thursday, having no information of the
Mullah, a strong reconnaissance was made towards
Gerrowei, and a patrol sent out to the South East.
This latter party reported a body of dervishes
advancing on Gerrowei; so the Camel Corps, leaving
twenty rifles at Bihan, moved quickly out, and
coming up with the dervishes in broken ground
North of Gerrowei, attacked at once. The
mounted dervishes fled; the footmen showed fight,
and were galloped down by a pony company who
were joined by the reconnoitring party from
Gerrowei. The enemy horsemen were pursued,
rounded up, and their horses captured, although
some of the riders succeeded in escaping on foot.
But few of the footmen, who broke at the first
charge, escaped.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, before midday, a small party
of enemy horsemen, with a few camels, moving
towards the Haud were reported by scouts, so
leaving the main body to mopping-up operations,
the fittest ponies of the Camel Corps were sent in
pursuit, a difficult one over rough country. This
party accounted for the remainder, eight men killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and two captured, one of the former being an
Abyssinian of some rank.</p>

<p>It was then ascertained that the Mullah was still
unaccounted for. He had slipped off to one side
with three or four followers, and had arrived at a
well. This was found to be almost dry, but sufficient
water was obtained by the party to give the broken
and tired old man, and his pony, a drink. He lay
down on the desert to rest, whilst the few survivors
of his bodyguard pushed on to find water. On their
return the Mullah had gone. Where? No one
knows!</p>

<p>Better that he had remained alive, and had pushed
far South to join his brother Khalifa, and so to
relate at first hand the tale of his own defeat, ruin,
and utter degradation. For now the few surviving
men who still believe in him will say, should he have
perished in the desert, that Allah at the last sent
angels to lift him up and bear him away to Paradise.</p>

<p>The men who carried back the water came into
the British lines and surrendered, knowing that the
game was up. Knowing, as all men who have
knowledge of Somaliland know, that the Mad
Mullah's career of cruelty, rapine and crime was at
last at an end.</p>

<p>Garabghari had fallen to a naval landing party
from H.M.S. <i>Odin</i>. The friendlies had entered
Tale. Gibb, led by the Mullah's favourite son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
went round the forts and ordered the broken
dervishes out. They came without firing a shot,
marvelling that they, who had never shown mercy
nor spared a life, should be so humanely treated.</p>

<p>The Camel Corps, leading their tired animals,
returned on foot to Hudin. On the 24th
February the last air-force load was cleared from
El-dur-Elan on the return journey to Berbera, and
the expedition was over. Somals of the West
hearing, by the wonderful native system of communication,
that the Mullah was broken, vied with one
another in their expressions of loyalty to the
Government. A man who attempted to murder an
official in 1916 near Zeila, came in from Abyssinia
and surrendered for fear that the terrible bird-men
should come to find him. British prestige in Somaliland
had been entirely restored and the country, after
twenty years of unrest, is at last at peace.</p>
